the whole of Gaul’; B. C. ιιι. 31 5 a civitatibus tyrannisque magnas

Celtiberiae] the country of the Celtiberi, corresponding roughly to the
provinces oi Guadalajara and Cueuca. Their name signifies that they
were a mixed race ol Celts aud Iberians: cp. Lucan ιν. 9 preffufflque a
gente vetmta Ι Gallorum Celtae miscentes namen Hiberis.

Cantabris] a powerlul tribe on the N. coast, srom whom the Bay
oi Biscay received the name oi mare Cantabricum. They were with

light armed troops, carrying the cetra, a light Spanish shield 3 cp. Lucan
vn. 23² illic pugnaces commovit Iberia cetras.

ulter-saris Hispaniae] Madvig would omit these words, but the
omission oi Hispaniae alone would, Ι think, be sufficient. The scutatae
were drawn from the alesin prouincia, the cetratae from the ulueiar,
and the cavalry from both ; true, that we read of cetratae belonging
