108 DE BELLO CI VILI [ιιι. 1.

between the ocean, the upper course of the Garonne, M. barbieres and

the Pyrenees

3 audierat] the beginning ol the sentence is apparently lost and with' 1t
the subject ol' audierat,¹ possibly Varro. The report about Pompey’s
approach was baseless.

sumpsit] KH consider that the subjectos this sentence as well as os
the last is some other than Caesar.

4 quod...deaiaxit] this does not imply that the officers were wavering
in their allegiance, but that their enthusiasm would be stimulated by the
knowledge that only by a victory and the consequent spoils of war
would their ioan be repaid.

redemit] ‘’;purchased cp. B. G. 1. 44 quarum antra'um gratiam
atque amicitiam eius marte redimere possa.

Cure. XI.

ι pantes] these no doubt crossed the Segre between Ilerda and the
confluence ol the Noguera Rivagorzana with the Segre about 6 miles
(ro kilometres) N.E. of Ilerda. Caesar says they were 4 miles apart,
and we may fairly assume that the lower bridge was about 3 kil.
above Ilerda, and the upper about 1 kil. below the junction oi the two
rivers. M. Stoffel places Fabius’ camp on the right bank near the lower
bridge and about a miles N. of Ilerda. 1 adopt this view as to the
situation of the camp and bridges, after carelul consideration, in pre·
lerence to that of Hert Schneider who places the lower bridge, together
with the camp adjacent, near the confluence ol the rIvers, aud so at
a distance of about ιο kil. from Ilerda, aud the upper bridge 4 miles
sarther up stream.

his parabus] ablative of way or direction3 cp. B. G. v. 19 anrnr'bas
viis semitisque essedarios ex silvis emittebat ; Roby ἓ 1176.

citra] ‘on this side’ i.e. on Fabius’ side, consequently on the right
bank.

a hac ilemfere] ‘something of the same kind’: cp. B. G. νι. ¹7 de his
eandem fere quam reliquae gentes opinatum lrabeat. But Dr Reid
prefers to take sere with the verb faciebant.

Pompeiam] the Pompeian troops crossed hya bridge of their own
(cp. ξ 4 sua patae) which connected Ilerda with the opposite bank. It
was made of stone, cp. Lucan lv. 15 saxeus ingenti quem parts annila·
armana.
