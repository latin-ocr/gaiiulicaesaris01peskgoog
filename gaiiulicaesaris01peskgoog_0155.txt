124 DE oraro correo. [un. 1. ¹

quoad] ‘so long as’: cp. Β. G. 1v. 12 quood potuitfortissime restitit,-
elsewhere in Caesar quood means ‘until'.

detergere] ‘sweep ofi' ; the oars in an ancient manos-war could not
be ‘shipped' as readily as in a small sowing boat. Florus 1. 18 ὅ 8
uses detorquere remos apparently in a similar sense.

3 cum...tum] ior cum...tum ‘not only...but also’ connecting two verbs,
cp. Β. G. v. 4 qnod oum nectito eius a se fieri intellegebat tum magni
interesse arbitrabatur ‚- vn. 23 cum...est...tum...laabet; Caes ap. Cic.
Au. lx. 652 atque ego cum ex ipsa re magnam capio voluptatem, tum
meum sactum probari ais te triumpho gaudio: more often it is used
with two contrasted substantives as in B. G. vl. 30 multum cum in
omnibus robustum in re· militari potest fortuna: sometimes etiam is
added to emphasise the tuor, cp. 62 ᾗ a cum altitudine aquae tum etiam
rapiditate fluminis

nequedum...cognitis] ‘inasmucb as they did not yet know even the
names of the various tackle'. The clause is suspected by some editors
oi being a gloss.

usiam celeritatis] celeritatis is a defining genitive explaining in what
the anus consiste, ‘the same handiness in point oi speed'. But KH take
it rather differently, ‘the useiulness which speed gives'.

4 dum] ‘provided that’ ; not elsewhere so used in Caesar.

diversi] ‘on opposite sides' ; one oi Caesar's ships grappled two of
the Massilian ships, and so the crew of the former bad to sustain a
conflict in two directions, a hostile crew being on each side oi them.
It was in this battle that a centurion oi the Xth legion named C. Acilius,
having lost bis right hand while boarding one of the enemies' ships,
seized bis sword in his lest hand aad fought gallantly on till the crew
surrendered. The story is told by Plutarch Caes. 16, Suet. Caes. 68,
Valerius Maximus 111. a. aa. ’

cunr eis, quae sunt captae] ‘including those that are captured ’. The
iorm ol expression is extremely awkward and the text is probably
corrupt. From 11. 5 §r we learn that six ships were captured, hence
Paul ingeniously suggests naves Massiliensium Domitiique sunt captae
Vl, intereunt IX. In 57 5 4 the proper name Domitii is corrupted in
the uss into indomiti.

Curae. LIX.

r nuntiatur] the date of this sea-fight may be determined with
sufficient precision. It has been assumed that the flood at Ilerda
began aBJune, cp. 48 ἕ 13 it lasted several days, 505 1 liae perman·
