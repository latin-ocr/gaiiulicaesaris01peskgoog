APPENDJX 163

ynastri does not occur in the rnss; if written compendiously it might

easily be absorbed by the nt of the previous word.

neque dum etiam MSS3 the phrase is rather awkward with trun
etium immediately following, but 1 see no reason to regard it as
corrupt.

59 alonge rtss; most editors longo. The ablative may be defended by
B. G. rv. 10 Rhenus...longo spatio per fines Nurrtuatium...er'tntus
ferrur. Meusel retaining longe alters argentius to arrgustrbre to agree
with spatio.

3 praeter consuetudinem omnium MSS3 as Caesar does not elsewhere
add orrrnium to the phrase praeter consuetudinem Paul would read
oenniieo, but I do not think the change is necessary.

constituerant russ3 Meusel‚ Paul, Dinter‚ instituerant for no valid
reason.

00 a insequuntur Mss; as insequi generally means ‘hostili animo sequi'‚
Meusel and Paul would read sequuntur here and sequebatur in 11.
38 ἕ 35 but in other writers insequi often means ‘to follow ’, ‘to
corne next ’, and Caesar himself uses the participle insequens in this
sense with anneus and dies. I see no reason therefore to alter the
text.

01 aipsi locis excedere nss3 the addition of Iris or iis before or aster locri
is hardly necessary.

3absentis timebant mss, inserting Pompei between nransemnt and
nugaris. All editors since Davis agree in placing the name after
absenn's.

4 conquirere Τ ologesma Mss; editors conquirere et Octogesum; Hotoman
conquiri which would make the sentence more regular, but departs
more widely from the reading of the uss.
aberat XX Mss; geographical considerations require that XXX
should be read. Numerals of this kind are of course peculiarly liable
to corruption in ress. ⁸
castraque Of, castra hle, muniuntur all mss. I read with Paul
castra neuneientur, other editors eastra meeniunt.

02 1 reduxerat rem uiss3 Caesar always deducere rem, hence Paul reads
deduxerat rem. 1 prefer rem deduxerat, which if written νῑ deduxerat
would easily be corrupted to reduxerat and then rem would be added,
In all other passages in Caesar the noun precedes the verb.

a exstare et MSS, except b which has exstarent et, no doubt rightly.

08 r castra coniungunth l f, iungunt a b; the former is read by Paul and
E. Hoffmann.
