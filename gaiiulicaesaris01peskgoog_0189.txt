158 DE Basso cruris.

28 aquinquagznto ordines Mss; the editors generally read quinque
ordinis senatorii aster Davis and Nipperdey, but E. Hoffmann
retains quinquaginta, reading nant quinquaginta ; ordinis senatorii
etc.

L. Caecilius Spinther Rufus sisa, aa evident confusion, the name
Spinther belonging properly to Lentulus. We may read either
L. Caecilius Rufius, ior whom see note, or L Vibullius Rufius who
has been mentioned before.

gloquitur quod uss: the insertion of queritur after loquitur had
occurred to myseli before I saw that it had been suggested by
Halbertsma and is actually adopted by Paul, who however alters
loquitur to loeutus. But Ι leave the textas it stands, not being
confident that it is wrong.

4ab iis (or his) uirus MSS, apparently corruptions of Hatris. Momm-
sen proposes IVoiris, but the provincial quattuorviri seem to bave
consisted of two bodies of duoviri one of which may have had higlrer
powers than the other.

5 ee die nss3 Mensel, Dinter and Paul needlessly read eodem die.

2⁵ 3 iuumiri Μῦες Paul needlessly suggests invenire.

extremis uss; most editors ab extremes, some proposition being
needed: Dr Reid suggests ex maritimis.

6 pedum XXX all uss except l which lras LXXX.
9 incursus Mss3 Paul thinking the word unsuitable reads engressus.

20 r turres curu terur's tabulatis Mss3 Paul argues that the preposition
cannot be thus used and so reads quaternis, which if written IV ternis
might easily become eum ternis. l retain the traditional reading
though admitting that no exact parallel to it has been produced.

opero disturbaret tiss: Paul suggests the omission oi opera

2⁷ guppidum irrumperent russ3 see note.
>ninaequat siss3 the word is not found elsewhere and Dr Reid

suggests ins'ecta aequat.

5sagittariis Mss3 better sense would be obtained by reading cun
sagittariis conjectured by Koechly and Reid. Meusel prefers sagitta·
rios funditoresque, assuming the words to have been changed to the
ablative by the proximity ol ex moratis.

2ο 3oeterem exercitum nrss; there is no need lor Elberling's vetere

exercitu adopted by Paul. Caesar did not like the idea oi Pompey’s
veteran army in Spain being confirmed by the presence of its leader
without any interierence on his own part.

restauras Ill srss; Davies altered the number to I V. comparing
