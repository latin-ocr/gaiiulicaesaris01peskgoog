a difficult post to administer, and was therefore assigned to the most

Philippus et Cotta] L. Marcius Philippus, consul 56. He was
connected by marriage with the Julian family, being the second
husband of Atia, mother of Augustus and daughter of Caesar’s sister
Julia and Μ. Atius Balbus. This would sufficiently account for his
being passed over in favour of the later consul Domitius. Similarly
L. Aurelius Cotta, consul 65, was passed over, Caesar's mother having
been an Aurelia and possibly Cotta’s sister. The following genealogical
table will make this note clearer.

of office as consul or praetor and the provincial governorship‚ the

catering on his consulship or praetorship would not be interrupted, the
offices being continuom, aud so would cover both the home and the
foreign administration3 but the magistrates here mentioned whose office
had expired sorne years would in the ordinary course of things require a
fresh decree of some sort (see Mommsen, Rechtsfrage, n. 116) conferring
the imperium. In the words quod superioribus annes acciderat Caesar
has in his mind the conferring of the imperium on the incoming consul
or praetor before 52, which r'mpm'um as stated abore would not need
