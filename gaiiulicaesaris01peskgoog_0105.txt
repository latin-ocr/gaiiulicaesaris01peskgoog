74 DE BELLO CI VJLI. [ma. 1.

the Aedui, perhaps at Matisco (Micon). Stoffel rechons that it would
take it 35 days to march from Micon to where it overtoolr (corrsequitur)
Caesar between Auximum and Asculum, a distance of about 620 miles
Hence he concludes that the courier summoning the legion must have
been sent from Ravenna as early as rr Dec.

proficiscitur] Caesar probably marched byFirmum (Formo) a few
miles from the coast, and Truentum a town at the mouth of the Truen-
tus (Tronto). See on16§ 1.

Asculum] Ascoli on the Tronto, destroyed in the social war91.
LS are wrong in referring to Florus 1. r8 ἓ 9, as the town there spoken
of is Asculum or Ausculum in Apulia where there was a battle between
Pyrrhus and the Romans.

Spinther] P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther, aedile 63 (Sall. Cat. 47),
consul 57. He was a firm friend and supportet of Cicero.

X cohortibus] this expression is used in preference to the more
obvious una legione no doubt because these cohorts were contingents
from different legions, or recently levied at different times and places
and not yet incorporated into one homogeneous body: cp. B. G.
v. 9.

aducmu] Stoffel malres it appear probable that aduentus here signi·
fies ‘approach’ rather than ‘arrival ’‚ as Lentulus seems to have left
Asculum on the 5th while Caesar did not reach it till the 8th The
addition too of cognito rather supports this view3 and see note on 16
ἓ ²5 30 ἕ 5·

4 Rufum] L. Vibullius Rufus, a Pompeian but highly respected by
Caesar into whose hands he twice fell, once at Corfinium 34 θ 1, and
again in Spain 111. 105 1 and 1. 86 ἕ 3.

bominum] ‘the people there’, ‘the inhabitants': cp. 5 ἓ 5.

5 Camerino] a town in the Umbrian Apennines, now Camerino,
situated on the road to Ancona.

Lucilium Hirrum] one of the tribunes of 53.

excutit] ‘takes up ⁵, piclrs up': cp. B. G. vn. 28 quos ille...cx suga
excepit.

XIII] Pompey in a letter to Cicero of 10 Feb. (or, according to
Μ. Stofsel, the rrth) says is [Q. Fabius) nuntiat L. Domitium cum suis
cohortibus XII etcum cohortibus XIV, quos Vibullius adduxit, ad nte
iter babere,·...C. Hirrum cum V cohortibus subsequi: thus making the
total of Vibullius' and Hirrus’ forces 19 cohorts‚ whereas Caesar makes
the number 13· Caesar does not say how many cohorts Vibullius
received from Lentulus nor how many he got together from the levies
