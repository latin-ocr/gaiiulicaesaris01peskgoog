110 DE BELLO CI VILl. [Lus. ι

Caesar had lest or retained 900 to serve as his own body-guard; the
rest had been seut fortvard under Fabius.

iu castra peruenit] four old Roman caleudars give a Aug. as the date
of the capitulation ol Afranius and Petreius. Curio in his speech ιι. 3²
ὅ 5 states that Caesar effected the conquest in 40 days lrom his first
appearance before the Pompeian camp, which would thus lall 23 June.
From §a we learn that he took up his position belore the hill ol
Gardeny, where the Pompeiaus were eucamped, the day alter his
arrival at the camp os Fabius. He therefore reached the latter aa June.
The joumey lrom Massilia to Ilerda, a distance os about 394 miles, might
take r8days (Statim), which would malie the date ol his leaving Massilia
about 5 June. These dates must of course not be regarded as anything
more than approximate, lor we cannot be sure that Curio’s 40 days is to
be interpreted strictly.

tempestate] this word, which originally meant a period ol time, then
weather good or bad, came to mean usually bad or ‘tempestuous’
weather3 so too valetudo which was originally any state os health came
to mean bad health, whence our ‘valetudinarian ’.

a sex cohortes] probably one from each ol his six legions.

triplici instructa acie] the army consisting os 54 (60 - 6) cohorts was
drawn up before starting in three lines: hya quartu-turn to the right they
were t'ormed into three columns, and so marched to their destinatiou.
When the heads of the columns reached the right os the hill ol Gardeny
a quarter-tum to the leit would bring them back into three lines ready
lor action (Stoffel).

sub amnis] this and iu armis are used indifferently3 cp. below §4

’ acies in aruris..perrrmnebat.

iu medio colle] ‘hall way up the hill '.

3 stare] ‘that it was ouly owing to Afranius that a pitched battle was
not fought't cp. 11. 13 ἃ 4 graviterque eam rem tulerunt quod stetisse per
Trebonium, quo minus opprim potirentur, videbatur: in this usage stare
takes quin or quo minus or ne.

intermissis] with ab. ‘at an interval of about eoo paces from '.

4 qreorl...erat] ‘which could not sail to bea prominent object and
visible from alar’.

XV] this denotes the width ot' the losse at the top, not the depth.

post hos] cp. Lucan tv. 28 prono tum Caesar Olympo Ι in noctem
serbita circumdedit agmina fissa, J dum primae perstant (or praestant)
acies, hostemque se ellit, J et prope consertis obduxit castra maniplis.
