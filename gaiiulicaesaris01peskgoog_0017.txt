access to most ol the higher offices of state, and as the posses·
sion of these offices conlerred nobillty a new order ol nobles
had arisen, who became in time as exclusive as the old patricians,
and by their numbers and wealtlr succeeded in concontrating in ’
their own hands all the powers of government. The senate,
which was chiefly composed of the new nobility, had now
virtually absorbed most of the iunctions ol the popular as·

was unsuccesslul in spite os the lact that Gaius profiting by the
experience os Tiberius endeavoured to establish his relorms on
awider basis. Two of his measures merit particular attention

assraught with consequences ior the future. He instituted the
