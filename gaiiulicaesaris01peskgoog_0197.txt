166 DE BELLO CI VILI.

5 auxiliis Mss; Madvig auxilia for no satisfactory reason.

80 4relietis legionibus nss; Herzog’s reliquis adopted by Paul would
hardly be sense and is not supported by the two passages quoted in

defence of it, B. G. 11. 17 § a and tv. 245 r: the best correction
that l have seen is refectis adopted by E. Hoffmann and Dinter.
KH think that the word legionibus took the place ol impedimentis
which was then transferred to follow praesidia, and so read relictis
impedimentis subsequitur, praesidio paucas etc.
01 gemuertunt ress3 Madvig conserunt, Pauly conectunt. No change is
needed.
remedia dabantur uss 3 Madvig unneeessarily irridebantur. ’
5supplices male haberi uss, but b and perhaps a have suppliciis,
which is no doubt right aud is accepted by recent editors.
6 adid expeditiores uss ; id is meaningless; I accept iter suggested by
, Manutius and adopted by Paul.
02 1 Caesaris MSS, Paul Caesari, which is very likely right.
rei quae ruriniteanis fiebat causa (or causa fiebat) mss; Forch·
hammer restored reliquae: when this had been corrupted to rei quae,
fiebat was added to make some sense. Nipperdey with less pro·
bability bracketed the words quae munitionis fiebat.
a proelii) dfiugisse nss3 praelium defugisse is required.
3 eisdem decausis uss; it seems necessary to eject de with Paul.
spatii brevitas...ad sumtuum uictoriae nss; Madvig spatii breuitate
...ad summm uictoria, so too Meusel. I prefer to retain the text.
ruine nss3 though hinc is not elsewhere used by Caesar in this
partitive sense, Ι prefer retaining it to reading horum with Paul.
88 1 tertia mss3 the corruption is due to the preceding acies.
3The mss omit ne, and hl insert nan before comrra'tteret5 it is more
likely that ne was absorbed by nisi than that it was omitted or
corrupted into nan before committeret. 1 therefore follow Nipperdey
and other recent editors rather than Paul.
tanuen Mss3 the editors alter this to tum; the two words are
often confused in Mss, yet Ι cannot see the need for change here.
The idea is ‘though each seemed to attain his object, yet the affair
drags on and in reality neither side gains any advantage ’.
84 4 feminas MSS, a strange blunder for seras.
, 5necesre habeant Oaf, necesse habeat h l, rightly I think. So Paul
after Madvig. .
8³ ase omitted in uss, rightly supplied by Aldus: the omission led to
the false reading noluerint for noluerit.
