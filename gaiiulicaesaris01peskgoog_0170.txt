cuna. nxx11.-nxxrv.] NOTES. 139

and is rare in other authors.

3 cohortium alariarum] auxiliary cohorts, the auxiliarios ol the allies
being always stationed on the wings oi the army, and called alo dextro
and sinistra: cp. 835 1, 11. 185 1, B. G. 1. 51.

aquam] this water supply was evidently some way off, but we do
not know its exact position. Stoffel says there is now no 'water in the
district, except in reservoirs. A stream marked in Schneider’s map and
called Llobregds en Pino, ii it really exists or did exist, would answer
the roquirenrents oi the passage, being about 5 miles N.E. oi Mayals.

Cnan. LXXIV.

1 notum] practically a substantive, ‘acquaintance'3 so below ἓ 6.
ηικηὰψιιη] ‘follow-townsman ¹, so civis olten means ‘seiton-citizen:
the compounds cominu communiceps were very little used, und do not
occur ia classical authors. ι,
conquirit] ‘enquires aiter', very much like our colloquial phrase
‘looks up'.
u pridie] cp. 72.
benefico] ‘through their kindness’, ‘thanks to them’3 cp. B. G. 1. 53
sortium beneficio se esse incolumem, B. C. 11. 32 ἓ 8, 111. 18 ᾗ 4.
quaenunt] ‘they enquire about ², cp. B. G. 1.18 quaerit ex solo ea
quoe iu conventu dixerut,⁴ see note on 67 §1; two other instances os
quaerere with accusative, B. G. 1. 18 eadem quaerit and Β. C. 11. 39
5 3 relrbua quaerere, are not necessarily similar, these being possibly
cognate accusatives. Here Madvig reads with great probability deiude
de imperitioris fide quaemut.
illi] ‘to him ².
contulerint] arina conferre cum aliquo ‘to eugage in conilict with ’,
cp. Livy xxl. 1 uam neque validiores opibus ullae iuter se civitates

to collect arms, as in Β. G.V11. ia arma conferri, equos produci, obsides
dari iubet.
3 Jirlem...petunt] ‘exact a solemn promise '.

p, 39. confirmatis] ‘these conditions having been settled’: the ablative
absolute may possibly be equivalent to a conditional sentence ‘ii
these conditions are settled ', as Moberley takes it. Notioe the near
repetition oi confirmare, which seems a mark ot' hasty writing.

signa translaturos] cp. ²4 ἕ 3, 60 ἕ 4.
