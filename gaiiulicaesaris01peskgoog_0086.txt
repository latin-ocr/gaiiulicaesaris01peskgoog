caer. ιν. v.] NOTES. 55

Cic. Lag. 111. aa quam ab rem in ista quidm re veliementer Sullam
probo, qui tribunis plebis ma lege e'reiurioe faciendae potestatem ademerit,
auxilii serendi reliquerit ,· Vell. ιι. 30, Appian B. C. 1. 59, ιοο; see
below 7 ἓξ a, 3. [Caesar must be exaggerating in his reference to Sulla,
it the statements are true that Sulla restricted the tribunes to the
auxilii latio. One cannot believe that Sulla would have allowed
validity to the use oi the intercessio which these tribunes attempted.
J· s. a]

a septim de'e] on Jan. yth, but they entered on office on Dec. ioth,
hence Caesar means on the seventh day after the beginning oi the policy
inaugurated by the new consuls on Jan. ist. .

quoa] this is the object of respicere and refers to de sua salutecogitare‚·
the words ae timere are added as a sort oi asterthought.

post octo denique menses] Moberley refers to the case of Tib. Gracchus
who was killed in about the eighth mouth of his tribunate. He might
also have referred to M. Livius Drusus who was murdered in the ninth
month of his tribunate in tac. 91. The text however is corrupt.

actmnum] cp. Liv. v. ιι tribuni celebrare actiones: ‘official acts’.

respicere ae timere] the same words in B. G. νιιι. ay.

3 extremum atque ultimum] so iar as there is any difference between
these words perhaps extremum marks a thing as being the last of a
series while ultimum brings out in a stronger degree its finality; cp.
cic. Fin. ι. ιι quaeritur, quid sit sines, quid extremum, quid ultricium.

senatusconsultum] this decree‚ the terms of which are given below,
was ‘a purely negative measure, the setting aside ot' constitutional
checks which stand in the way of the preservation os the state’ (Nissen).
It had been issued in ⁵² and in 63, as well as on other occasions,
when the position of affairs was hardly more critical than in this
year 49. Caesar is probably trying to mislead his readers; see note
on r s s-

omnium salute's] a double genitive aster desperatione ‘amid the
general despair oi safety’.

sceleratorum audacia] a probable conjecture: ‘through the audacity
oi wicked men '.

quique proconsulibus] ‘and those who in the place of consuls’ i.e
‘and those proconsuls who’; the noun proconsul is merely a convenient
form to express the more strictly correct pro consule. In decrees oi this
kind sometimes no magistrates except the consuls are mentioned.

p. 4. 4 perscribuntur] decrees were always recorded in writing with the

signatores os witnesses appended, who were said scribendo adesse.
