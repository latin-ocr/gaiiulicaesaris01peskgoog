daretur, ne ea causa maturius et inmerfecto adhuc belle decederet. [Is it
fanciful here to see in the use of the words expleri coepisset in place of
the more natural expletum esseta vague reference to the strict termination
of the proconsular command at the end of Feb. 49, which might
however without illegality be prolonged to 3¹ Dec. 49?] The command
was conferred on Caesar for 5 years from 1 Mar. 59, but Caesar instead of
eutering on it at that date, which he probably might have done although
he was at the time consul, preferred, in obedience to the directions of
the Cornelian law by which a consul was obliged to remain in the city
during his year of office, to enter on his proconsular command on 1 Jan.
58. Reckoning from this date the two periods of 5 years would not
expire till 3¹ Dec. 49. cp. Plut. Caes. 29, App. 11. 25.
