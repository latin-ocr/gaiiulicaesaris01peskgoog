68 DE BELLO CI VILI. [Lm. 1.

if he should stay in Italy till Caesar’s consulship was over, that is, till
the beginning of 47. But the text is probably faulty, and there is little
point in the reference to the end of Caesar’s office. I should like to read
si peractis consularibus conrr'tiis uon profectur esset. Caesar would then
refer to the possibility of Pompey's remaining in Italy at the head

of an army till aster the consular electioris and so influencing their
result.

4 itaque...occupat] Nissen remarks that in this paragraph Caesar
distorts the sequence of events inan incredible way. The news of the
capture of these towns reached Rome before Cicero left the city, which
he didon the 18th, cp. Att. lx. 10 ἓ 4, Fam. xvr. 12 ἓ a. Yet Caesar
here says that he did not occupy them till after he had received Pompey's
reply, which could not have reached him before the 29th1 The course
of events was somewhat as follows. The tribunes were expelled from
the senate on 7Jan.; news of this reached Caesar at Ravenna on the
roth; he at once advanced‚ crossed the Rubicon on the 11th and
occupied Ariminum on the rath, where he met the fugitive tribunes.
Here he harangued his troops, dwelling on the insult done to the sacred
tribunicial office. Without delay he pushed forward detachments of
troops to occupy Arretium and the coast towns. Meanwhile Pompey
not having yet heard of the crossing of the Rubicon sent L. Caesar and
Roscius with proposals to Caesar, whom they found at Ariminum on or
about the ryth. About the r9th Caesar sentthem back again to Pompey
with whom they had an interview at Teanum on the a3rd. After a
further deliberation at Capua on the a5th the envoys returned to Caesar
at Ariminum, arriving there about the roth. The news of Caesar's
crossing of the Rubicon and capture of the Italian towns, brought
presumably by successive messengers‚ reached Rome, as stated above,
before the 18th, probably on the 15th, r6th, and 17th, and consequently
rrfter Pompey’s first mission. 1 have here given a brief summary of
M. Stoffel’s careful investigations into the perplexing chronology of this
period.
