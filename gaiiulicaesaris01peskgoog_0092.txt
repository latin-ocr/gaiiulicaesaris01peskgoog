t nomem] to inflict armed violence on a tribune would be a most
heinous offence3 in lact Cicero says there was an old law that anyone
who struck a tribune was punishable with death. It does not appear
however that on this occasion any actual violence was used; cp. Cic.
Fam. xvn 11 Antonius quidem uerteret Q. Cassius nulla vi expulsi ad
Caesarem cum Curione profecti erant: even in Appian, Β. C. 11. 33,
where great stress is laid on the insult done to the tribunes, the consuls
are represented as only using violent language5 ol ὕπατοι Μάρκελλός re
eal Λέντλος έκέλευον τοῖς ἀμφί τὸν ’Λντώνιον ἐκστῆναι τοῦ συνεδρίου, μή τι

sectaretur] Madvig ej. vetaretur, but this use os ueto is not elsewhere
iound in Caesar, and seems to be confined to poetry and later prose, cp.
Tac. Hist. 1. ea mathematici genus haruinum quod iu ciuitate uestra et

sostened hythe proximityoi opprimeretur on which the chiel stress ol the
