Ebro and on the right of the Segre in the angle formed by their junction.
Gbier places it on the lest of the Ebro, near Almatret, about half way
between Mequinenza and Flix. So far as I know, Mr Moberley stands
alone in assuming it to have been in the angle formed by the two rivers
just opposite Mequinenza. On the whole I incline to Stoffel's view
rather than Schneider’s. Gbler appears to bave been misled by inferior
maps: see Schneider's ‘Krilik der Spezialkarten ’.
