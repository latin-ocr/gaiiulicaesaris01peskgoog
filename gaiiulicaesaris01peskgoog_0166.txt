3 retorquere] it is not quite clear how much ‘ot' Caesar’s march wesin
view of the Afranians; it it be supposed that the whole oi it lrom the
moment oi leaving the camp was executed in their sight, the last part of
my note on magna circuitu 68 ἓ 1 must be modified accordingly. Ι
think it prohable however that Caesar’s column when it first wheeled
to the right was under cover of the hilis and so out of sight oi the
enemy. In that case the words retorqueri ad dextram will refer not to
the initial stage ot the southward movement, but to the subsequent
gradual reappearance of the column moving towards the right over the
rising ground.
