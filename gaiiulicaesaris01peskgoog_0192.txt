APPENDIX. 161

2 reliquit af, relinquit hl: there is nothing objectionable in the se·
quence reliquit, preficiscitnr, constitit, jacit. Paul reads relinquit
aud consistit to secure uniformity.

4 past leae ress, by careless assimilation to opus.

43 1 in oppido Ilerda ct proxima calle uss3 inter having been corrupted
to in, the rest followed as a matter of course.

planicia a (l) h l; most editors after other uss plam'eies. I
agree with Meusel who says midi ‘planicies' nulle arcada ferri passe
videtur, but 1 cannot accept his planitia.

3 in laces idoneis uss; Paul omits in as contrary to Caesar’s usage.

44 a reliquisque barbaris genere quodam nss; I read with Diibner and
Meusel reliquasque barbaris barbara genere quadam,· Dinter and KH
reliquisque barbaro. Nipperdey and E. Hoffmann retain the reading
of the MSS: for the text cp. 111. 9 ἕ r Dalmatis reliquisque barbaris.

3 quibus quisque uss, quibuscunque Paul.

4censneraat oportere Mss3 as oportere cannot easily be constructed
with seruare and discedere, Paul inserts consuerant after discedere,
thinking that its similarity to censuerant may have caused it to drop
out. Nipperdey and E. Hoffmann alter censuerant to consuerant,
making au almost impossible construction. Ι retain the reading ol
the MSS, adopting doubtfully the explanation given by KH: see note.
Iwould suggest as a possible emendation the insertion of se before
servare and the change of dimitti into dimittere.

,10 4 directus uss, but derectus is elsewhere the better attested form.

5 passuum Μῦες Meusel and Paul passus which is likely to be right.

7 augebantur illis copiae O h l, the rest augebatur illis capia which can
hardly be defended ; cp. B. C. 11. 41 ἓ 7 hostiurn caprae...augebantur.

10 grummum iugum Mss, except Ο bwhich have summum in iugum:
summa in iugum Forchhammer, and most recent editors. Nipperdey
in murmura ingram.

4⁵1 a initia MSS3 there seems no need for Paul's ab initia

48 4eamitatus tass; the same corruption in 51 ἓ 1; see too 54 ἓ 5,
B. G. vr11. 30.

5in hibernis nss; Hellebodius on the ground that this did not suit
the plural frumenta (standing crops) altered hibernis to herbis, but

v the plural seems to be conditioned by the following clause, neque
multum a maturitate adnant. I therefore with some hesitation
retain the reading of the ress. Paul reads habes, KH aranu,-
other suggestions are horreis, ceraunis, tabernas etc.

ὁ] r comr'latus ress; cp. 48 ἓ 4.
