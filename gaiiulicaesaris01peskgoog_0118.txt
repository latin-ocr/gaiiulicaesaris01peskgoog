transferunt] cp. 74 §3 se statim signa translaturos confirmant and
60 i 4 transit nram cohors Illurgauonensis ad eum cognito civitatis
romilio et sigua eu statione transfert where transire and signa transferre
occur together as in the present passage. Cicero Att. lx. 6 5 r says he
has heard sex cohortes, quae Albae fluissent, ad Curium ma dunucia
transisse. Stoffel thinks the junction may have taken place near Arpi,
the ruins oi which are close to the modern town of Foggia. Caesar
was at Arpi on r March, Cic. Att. rx. 35²·

4 reliquis itineribus] ‘during the remaining stages '.

agmen] the main body oi troops on the march3 they would probably
be preceded by the cavalry.

Cremona] ‘oi Cremona ⁹, ablative oi origin3 cp. 111. 71 C. Flegr'·
notem Placentia, A. Granium Puteolis, M. Sacrativirum capua: with
this one may compare the common use oi the ablative to denote the
tribe to which a person belongs as Q. Verres Romilia ‘oi the tribe
Romilia '.

praejectus fabrum] ‘chief engineer officer'. An army in the field
was always accompanied by an organised corps ot* engineers, sobri,
furnished with all the necessary appliances ior siege operations, bridge
building etc. Caesar mentions his arrest and dismissal oi Magius iu a
letter to Oppius, Cic. Att. tx, 7 c ἓ a.

5 interesse rei publicae] the genitive aiter interesse is probably depen-
dent on a neuter noun understood, ‘it is among (the advantages) of the
state ', ie. ‘it is one oi the interests oi the state'. So too it is suggested
thatin such phrases as mea interest, the word mea is not, as it is usually
taken to be, a feminine ablative singular, but a neuter accusative plural,
so that the meaning is ‘it is among my interests’, inter mea est.
Schmalz Lat. Synt. ἓ 78.

6 coram] ‘iace to sace '; not used by Caesar asa proposition.

Cura. XXV.

r legionibus Vl] see note on 18 i 5.
pervenit1cp. Cic. Att. 1x. r 3 Α §¹ r, Balbus sends Cicero a copy ol a
letter from Caesar to Oppius in which he says a. d. aii situs Martias
Brundisium ueni, ad murum eastra posui. Pompeius est Brundisii:
misit ad me Ν. Magium de pace ,· quae visa sunt respondi. This fixes
the date oi Caesar's arrival at Brundisium to 9 March.
compleverat] ‘had raised to their tull complement ’.
