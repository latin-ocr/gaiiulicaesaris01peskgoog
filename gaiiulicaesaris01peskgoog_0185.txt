APPENDIX ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ΤΕΧΤ.

Tira chief uss ol the Bellum Civile are four in number and date
probably from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. They are

Ursinianus (Vatican) denoted by h (U in Bellum Gallicum),
Riccardianus (Florence) ......... l

Thuaneus (Paris) a (Tin Bellum Gallicum),
vindobonensis (Vienna) ......... f

Specimen pages of the two last are given by Emile Chatelain in his
Paleographie des classiques Latins pp. 48, 50, and another on p. 49 of
a Florence MS, which 1 take to be the suine as lticcardinnus.

Other wss occasionally referred to by editors are (ll Haunlensis
primus (e of Nipperdey, H of Frigell and my editions of Bellum Galli·
cum), apparently a copy of Ursinianus, (ii) Leidensis primus (b of
Nipperdey, L of Frigell and my ed. of B. G.)‚ (iii) Scaligeranus (c of
Nipperdey), (ivl Cuiacianus (d of Nipperdey). Of the two last only
demhedOleadings are preserved. Meusel also refers to Dresdensis
primus( .

vanatrons.

(The large nurneral refers to the chapter, the small one to the sectr'on.)

1 ι Most mss insert a Fabio after litteris which Hoffmann and Diibner
take as a corruption of ab eo, and suppose that the beginning of the
book is lost.

a All uss in civitate, Hotoman infinite (see note); Dr Reid prefers
incitate or incitati: might the words be a late marginal gloss mean·
ing ‘iu the city ’‚ added to show that this meeting was held in Rome?
ep. 6. r habetur extra urbem senatus. Scaliger and others omit
them altogether. Heller prefers invitati.

2 ι All uss aderat. Dr Reid suggests that the clause quod...aderat is
a marginal gloss. ·
