0 96 DE BELLO CI VlLl. [nra. 1.

Varus, who happened to be in Africa whither he had fled straight from
Auximum (cp. 13 55 a, 3 ; 3152), took Ligarins’ place and became to
all intents and purposes the governor ol the province, of which indeed he
had formerly been propraetor. Tubero then on arriving in Africa found
his post already occupied and was not allowed roland, as we read in
the next chapter. It is for this reason that Caesar here says obtinere
debebat, ‘ought to have been in command of ', instead of obtinebat. At
a later period Tubero’s son impeached Ligarius for bearing arms against
Caesar. Ligarius was successfully defended by Cicero in a speech
which is still extant. Α

4 Cato] the account here given by Caesar of Cato’s proceedings is
slightly at variance with that given by Appian B. C. 11. 40, 41, who
says that Cato left Sicily on the arrival of Asinius Pollio whom Caesar
' had despatched at the same time as Valerius to Sardinia, and that
afterwards on reaching Rome Caesar nominated Curio governor of
Sicily in place of Cato. According to Plutarch Cato 53, it was the
arrival of Asinius Pollio together with tlte news of a lnrger force
adventing that forced Cato to leave Sicily: this helps to combine the
two accountsr the truth being that Cato did not retire immediately on
the arrival of Pollio with Domitius' cohorts‚ but only when he heard
'that there was a fresh force coming ; see below adventu Curionis cognito.
He left 23 April, cp. Cic. Att. x. 16 quoted above on5 a.
