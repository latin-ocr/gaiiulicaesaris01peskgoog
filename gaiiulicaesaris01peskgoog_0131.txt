100 DE BELLO CI VILI. [mn. 1.

pro se] ‘on his own behali’, to be taken with recusabat.

id munus legationis] ‘the duty os this embassy‘.

n discederes] Pompey’s cowardly abandonment of Rome disgusted his
friends, cp. ior instance Cic. Att. vu. 11 §4 fugiens denique Pompeius
mirabiliter homines mouet.

3 triduum] 1-3 April.

extrahitur] cp. 32 ξ 3 Catane...mora de'es extrahente where mara is
the same kind of ablatire as disputationibus here.

subicitur] ‘is put lorward '.

L. Metellus] the tribune’s most noteworthy exploit was to plant
himself in -sront of the treasury when Caesar was about to seize the
accumulated stores oi gold ; cp. Lucan 111. 114

pugnaxque Metellus

ut asael ingenti Saturnia templu reuelli

male, rapit gressus, et Caesaris agmina rumpens

ante fieres nondum reseratae constitit aedes.
He was soon removed by Caesar's threats and the intervention oi Cotta.
Caesar then appropriated the contents not only oi the ordinary treasury
but also of the sanctius amanium which by an old tradition was said to
be held in reserve sor the crisis oi another Keltic invasion: cp. Appian
B. C. ιι. 41 and notes on 14 ἕ ι. Itis noticeable that Caesar says
nothing here about his raid on the treasury.

distrahat] ‘thwart’ ; hanc rem is of course the proposed embassy.

quascunque agere instituerit] subjunctive because the clause is subor-
dinate to the final clause qui...impediat.

4 amittat] ‘throw away '.

proficiscitur] probably on 7 April, cp. Cic. Ast. x. 8 5 6quippe qui
florentissimus ae nouus VI VII diebus ipsi illi egenti ac perditae multi·
lua'ini in adium acerbissimum venerit, qui duanam renem simulationem
tam cita amiserit, mansuetudinis in Metello, diuitiarum in uraris: from
which it appears that Caesar incurred considerable enmity at Rome by
his actions on this occasion; cp. also Att. x. 4 ἓ 8.

ulterimne Galliam] Gaul beyond the Alps in contradistinction to
Gallia Cisalpina. Caesar wrote to Cicero ex itinere a letter dated 16
April (Ast. x. 8 n). M. Stoffel supposes that he reached Massilia, a
distance of nearly 590 miles from Rome, about 19 April.
