capa. xcvo-xmus] NOTES. 117

ex inferioribus ordinibus] ‘from the lower posts': ordo here means
the post of centurion, sometimes the centurion himself is called ordo.
lt is not quite clear whether Caesar means it to be inserted that
Fulginius was promoted at once to be prior hastatus without going
through all the intermediate gradations. Possibly the gradual advance·
ment described above was chiefly theoretical, and not always adhered to
in practice.

thing, and so oomes often to mean ‘reputation’, cp. B. G. ιι. 24 quorum
inter Gallos virtutes opinio est singulares.

existimarent] observe the historic present praefertur followed hythe
imperfect 3 cp. 485 r eoorr'trer ut...eonstaret.

a esse] there is no need sor esse here and I suspect from its awkward
position that it isan interpolation.

initia] ‘at the outset’z with ab initio (Paul) the meaning would be
‘from the outset'.

quae] one would expect qui referring to tumulum, but the relative is
attracted by the noun of the predicate} cp. B. G. lt. r Belgas quam
tertiam esse Gallroe partem deseramus, where quos would be more
natural.

...desertum

firmat.
