carr. nurum-Luxu] NOTES. 145

a peragitata] this word is not quoted lrorn any other classical suthon
possibly it is a corruption for exagitati.
montem excelsum] Stoffel says this is Sierra Grosa, which is at the
required distance ol 4 miles from the supposed site ol the last encamp-
ment, and is a conspicuous hill though hardly deserving to be called a
‘lolty mountain!
una fronte contra hostem] ‘on one side only laciug the enemy’:
instead os making the usual square entrenchment, they only constructed
one line of earthworks lacing the enemy.
neque...deponunt] ‘without however unloading the packhorses’:
mque here, as often, is put for neque tamen.
3 tabernacula] the Roman tents were made os skins, hence such expres·
sions as sub pellibus hiemare 111. 13 ἓ 5.
hora circiter sexta] it is absurd to suppose, as Stoll'el apparently does,
that all the events narrated from 73 5 1 to 80 ἓ 3 happened in the first six
hours ol one day, that is, before noon ol 29Ju1y. 1 have no doubt that
the eiusdem dier· ol the present passage means 30 July, and that the night
of 29Ju1y was spent by the Afranians in the anxious deliberations
implied in Caesar's narrative in 78. Thus the recital of the events ol
30 July naturally begins with the words hoc prolato consilio ex castris
preficiscuntur in 78 θ 4. Notice too the word cottidie in 785 a, whiehl
take to be a loose aud somewhat exaggerated expression lor the 60 or 70
hours from the discomfiture ol the Afraniana ou the syth (cp. γι) to the
morning os the goth.
spem...equitum] ‘hoping matthe pursuit would be delayed by the
departure ol our cavalry '.

1). 42. hora decima] about 4 pm.
cotlr'dr'anum itineris officium] ‘their usual employment during the
march’; their ‘usual (or ‘daily’) duty’ at this time was to harass the
retreating foe.
5 parrae terga corraertant] ‘are almost put to tlight’: the subjectos
convertentis of course the Afraniana.
nonnulli] ‘several‘ (see note on 78 ᾖ r) though denotinga less number
than ternplum.
