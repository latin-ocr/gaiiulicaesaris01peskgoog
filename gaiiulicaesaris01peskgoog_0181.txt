150 DE BELlO CI VILI. [mn. 1.

conduct ol himself and his army mentioned in 77, when he dismissed
unhanned all the soldiers of Afranius whom he lound in his camp,
though several os his own men had been put to death by that general’s
orders.

dc concilianda pace] cp. 26 ἓ 3, B. G. vu. 55.

3 su...caustitissc] ‘thus the part played by all ranks had been one of

compassion’ or ‘had consisted in compassion ’.

indutiarum] Caesar goes too sar in saying that the enemy’s officers
had disregarded the rights ol truce ; sor there had been no formal
cessation of hostilities when the intercourse between the two camps
mentioned in 74 took place, nor was the colloquium a formally arranged
conierence, but only a spontaneous act on the part ol individual soldiers.

per colloquium deceptor] ‘taken in by a pretended colloquy’; ριν is
osten thus used of a salse or pretended reason, cp. B. G. vl11.o3 qul
cum per simulationem colloquii curaret interficiendum ,· so peccatoram is
osten used ol a pretended reason as in B. G. v11. 9, cp. Draeger HS 1.
p. 607.

4 agitur] note that igilur occurs only here in Caesar.

eo] this as well as id is the antecedent to the following quod.

5 humilitate] ‘on the ground os their humiliation'r ablativa ci ‘efficient
cause', Roby§ 1228.

aliqua tempu-u opportunitate] ‘any fortunate conjuncture of events '.
postulare, qulbus rebus] ‘make demands whereby ’.

6 neque mim] ‘neither was it sor any other reason that six legions had
been sent into Spain and a seventh levied there’ etc. Caesar asserts
that this large army was maintained in Spain solely for the purpose of
being used against himself. The force originally designed sor Spain
consisted of four legions, Plut. Pomp. 5²³ to this had been added two
legions drawn srom Africa (Merivale 11. 175, on what authority I do not
know), and from the present passage (alone l) we leam that the remain-
ing legion had been levied in Spain itself‚ thus making the total ol seven,
as given also in 585 1.

tot tantasque classes paratas] this, the reading ol the MSS, is rejected

by most editors who think the mention of fleets out ol place here. No
doubt it is somewhat out of place in a speech addressed to Afranius and
Petreius and referring to events in Spain, but Caesar, writing iu haste
and indignation, thinks of all the fleets that had been equipped against
him during the last lew mouths and adds them to his mentiones the
Spanish army, forgetting that Afranius and Petreius had but little to
do with thena We have read in this hook oi the lieet that conveyed

'‘’ffll'el' from Brundisium (27), the ships raised hy Domitius &gakun
