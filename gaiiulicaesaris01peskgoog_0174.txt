Ilerda to Octogesa would make his men carry provision for more
than ro or ra days at the outside.

a facultates] ‘means’, ‘opportunities’3 the word is of constant use
in Caesar and does not by any means necessarily imply ‘pecuniary
resources’ as Moberley translates it.

insueta ad] the construction is found in Livy, but Caesar elsewhere
has the genitive after insuetus. The auxiliaries did not undergo the
severe training of the Roman legionaries and lacked their extraordinary
powers of eudurance.

3 explicitius] ‘the simpler’‚ ‘the less conrplicated ⁹, from explicare ‘to
unmvel’, a word frequently found with consilium as below se reliquum
consilum explicaturos, 111. 78 ἕ 3 eto, and cp. 111. 75 ᾗ a inexplicitis

. rebus.

se reliquum consilium explicaturos] a literal rendering of this is
impossible; we might represent the meaning fairly by translating
‘that they would evolve at leisure (or ‘in detail') the rest of their
plaus’. Moberley’s translation ‘to form plans for the future’ is
inadequate.
4 Tarraca] a distance of about ⁴0 or 50 miles.
recepere] rem is the subject, casus the object, of recipere? ‘their
adventure (⁸ fortune ’, ‘undertaking ') might meet with various accidents',
or ‘various accidente might befall their adventure': cp. 111. 51 ς 5 quae
res tamm fortasse aliquem reciperet casum.
preficumntur] probably iu the early morning of 29 Julyr see note ou
805 3.
p. 41. 5 carperet] cp. 6352, B. Afr. 7554.
nullum...proeliarentur] ‘not a moment passed without the rear·

guard fighting with the cavalry ’.

Cunn. LXXIX.

1 pluresque] ‘and several of them’, that is of the light-armed cohorts.
subsistebant] ‘halted'‚ ‘lingered behind ⁹, in order tu protect the
main body from the attacks of the cavalry. 'lber sense would no
doubt be rendered easier by reading equitesque for pluresque and
smtinebant for subsistebant ‘kept the cavalry in check ³.
3 cum] ‘whenever'3 with cum in this sense the pluperlect indicative is
more common than the imperfect, Roby ἓ ¹7¹7·
serberat] ‘lay before them ’.
neque ei...poterant]=et ea...uon poteraut.
