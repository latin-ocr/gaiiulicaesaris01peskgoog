a close political ally oi Pompey, and his utterances were not unnaturally
regarded as prompted by Pompey, especially as the latter was in the
neighbourhood ol Rome, though as proconsul and anned with the im·
perium he could not enter the city. A few days before this Pompey had
travelled with Cicero stom Lavernium (i) to Formiae, apparently on bis
way to Rome; Cic. Att. vir. 8 ἓ 43 see below ἓ 6 terrare praesentis Α

a aliquis] ‘some one': Caesar theu proceeds to particularise, mention·
ing Marcellus, Calidius, Rufus. Dr Reid's suggestion dixerant aliqui
would make the sentence simplet.

creptis] in the previous year a decree of the senate had been passed
that Caesar and Pompey should each fumish a legion sor the Parthian
war. Pompey undertook to provide the legion which he had previously
lent to Caesar. The latter accordingly had to give up this legion as
well as to furnish one os his own, thus losing the use os two legions, the
first and the fifteenth, while Pompey’s forces remained unimpaired: cp.
B. G. v111. 54. ,

ab co] one would rather expect a se, andrum, sor cius periculum

and retaining them near the city with a view to imperil him’ (Caesar).
The two legions were stationed either at Capua or in Apulia (cp. 14

troops with him near Rome: cp. Appian 11. 29, Dion xi. 65, xm. a ἐν

Caesar- Seventeen of his letters to Cicero written in the years 51-48
bave been preserved (Fam. viru).
