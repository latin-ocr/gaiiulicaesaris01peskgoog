xvi INTRODUCTION.

an army devoted to his interests and strong enough to cope in
case of need with the ‘veteran legions of Pompey. He started
for his province in March 58, and at once began the long career
of conquest, the details of which are familiar to all readers of
the ‘Bellum Gallicum! lt may suffice here to say that each
winter, when hostilities naturally ceased‚ he journeyed to the
borders of Italy to keep himself in touch with the political
movements of the capital and to confer with his adherents. ln
the spring of 56 he had a conference with Pompey and Crassus

, at Luca, and the political arrangements of the next few years

were doubtless the result of the discussions then held. ln the
following year by the law of Trebonius the province of Spain was

assigned to Pompey and Syria to Crassus, both for five years, and
another law prolonged Caesar’s tenure of his provincial admini-

his new province, where he soon engaged in war with the
Parthians, but Pompey remained in Rome and administered
Spain through his legates Afranius and Petreius. lt was in this
year that Julia, Pompey's wife and Caesaffs daughter, died,
whereby one of the chief linhs that bound the two great rivals
was severed. Their rivalry was still farther accentuated in 53
by the death of Crassus, who fell in battle with the Parthians.
To a superficial observer Pompey must now have seemed the
chief figure in the Roman world. He was master of the capital
and was elected sole consul for 52.

§14 State of feeling at Rome.

lt may be useful here to consider briefiy the general state of
feeling at Rome at this time. For this our best guide is the
correspondence of Cicero with Atticus and others. Cicero may
be regarded as reflecting on the whole the opinions of the mode-
rate optimates, who though nominally partisans of Pompey yet
felt almost as much distrust of their leader as they did of his

rival, Caesar, the champion of the democratic or popular party.
Above all things they desired peace, and to secure it they were
willing on occasion to sacrifice a little of their principles.
From these we may distinguish those whom Nissen calls the
