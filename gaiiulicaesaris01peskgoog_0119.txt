16 5 33 Plut. Pomp. 61, Cato 53; Appian B. C. 11. 40. On the
arrival os the 19 (i) Domitian cohorts under the command of Asinius
Pollio, Cato leit the island and repaired to Pompey at Dyrrachium. It
is noticeable that Pompey had intended sending these cohorts to Sicily
whither they were now dispatched by his rival Caesar, Cic. Att. vr11.
12 Α 5 3. Stoffel (1. 304) on inadequate grounds considers this clause a
late interpolation ; see note on 3⁰ 5 a.

Dyrrachium] now Durazzo, a seaport in Albania, the ancient
Epidamnus; it was the usual port of embarkatiou on the east of the
Adriatic corresponding to Brundisium on the west. The consuls took
30 cohorts across with them (Plut. Pomp. 62), so that Pompey's whole
force amounted to 50 cohorts, or about 25,ooo men. Cicero Ata rx. 6
5 3 reckons the total at 3o,0oo which may include auxiliary troops and
cavalry.

3 extremis] ‘furthest’, ie. from Rome, Brundisium being situated in
the heel oi the peninsula; it should probably be repeated with regionibus
‘the most outlying districts of Greece‘, cp. B. Af. 77 erebaueuses...in
extrema eius regni regione maritima locati. The ablative could not
stand here without a preposition, so Paul inserts ab] ex has been
suggested but would sound badly. Pompey, by occupying Brundisium
and Dyrrachium)would practically command the whole os the Adriatic
srom (ab) these two extreme points. Dr Reid thinks extremis is corrupt
and may have arisen from ex maritimis, which would make better sense.

au inopia] this was the real reason, cp. Dion xri. ra ἐπειδὴ ’γὰρ τὰ
πλοῖα οὐκ ἐξήρκεοέ odrae, προέπεμψεν ἄλλους τε rai τούς ὑπάτους, μή rai
νεοχμόσωσί τι rard χώραν ὑπομείναντες.

4 adminatratanes] ‘the working oi the harbour’ (Moberleyk

5 fauces] just off andisium the sea flows in between the lines os shore
that slowly converge till a channel of 350 yards minimum width is
sormed; the banks then recede again on either hand, the sea spreading
into two diverging streams, enclosing between them a projecting spur oi
the mainland, on the extremity oi which is situated Brundisium, exactly
opposite the above-mentioned charmel.

recoles atque aggerem] ‘piers and a dam ’. Cicero (Art. nt. 14 5 1]
gives the following extract from a letter written by Caesar to Q. Pedius,
received 14 March; Pompeius se oppido tenet ; nos ad portas castra
habemus. conamur opus maguum et nrultorum dremm propter altitudinem
maris, seal tamen nihil est quod potius sacramus: ab utroque portus cornu
moles iacimus ut aut illum quam primum traicere, quod habet Bruredr'sii
ceptionem, cogamus nect exitu prohibeamur ,⁴ cp. 1x. ra 5 1. Col. Stoffel‚
