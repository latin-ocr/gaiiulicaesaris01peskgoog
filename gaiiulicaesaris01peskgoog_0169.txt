138 DE BELLO CI VILI. [un. 1.

centuriones who had come to urge Caesar to fight, 71 5 a. Notice that
latin has no word os general signification quite corresponding to our
‘officer '‚ though dux sometimes approaches it, cp. ης ι duces adver·
sariorum.

uon probabatur] ‘did not commend itself to’ ε plerisque is dative, the
construction being protare aliquid alicui. But Caesar might have
written a plerisque as 74 ἕ 7 consiliumque eius a cunctis pabulatum
Β. G. 111. 24 troc consilio probato ab ducibusr and see quotation in note
on 5853.

degreditur] Caesar presumably occupied some slightly rising ground
not far from Afranius. But perhaps digreditur ‘moves away front'
should be read.

5 proesrile'is...dispositir] this ablative expresses the method by which

all the routes were blocked, and is therefore subordinate to the other
ablativo absolute omui intercluso itinere.

Crine. LXXIII.

t postero die] apparently 28 July.

spem] the slight harshness ol the phrase stuneieu‘s Hiberi spem ‘hope
ol (about) the river', i.e. ‘hope ol reaching the river'‚ is sottened by the
proximity oi the more natural genitive rei frumentariae ‘hope ol pro·
visrons’.

consultabant] Caesar has consultare three times and only with de,
cp. B. G. v. 53,v11. 77: but consulere only once with de, B. G.1. 53 de
se ter sortibus consultum dicebat.

a sr‘ reuerti velleret] ‘in case they should choose': these loosely
attached hypothetical clauses are not uncommon in Caesar, especially
with posse, but Ι find no instance quite like the present where the
main clause does not express some action on the part of the subject
ol the sentence: eg. it would have been quite regular is Caesar had
written renum ostendit iter etc. ‘he points out to them one route, in
case they wished' etc. Something similar is 84 §a palam ri colloqui
uellent, concessum est.

terraconem] it is not clear whether they proposed to reach
Tarragona by way of Granadella and Reus, crossing the higher part
of the Sierra de la Llena, or by returning some little distance on the
way to Lerida and then striking the present route from Lerida to,
Tarragona by way ol Borjas and Monblanch3 probably the former..
