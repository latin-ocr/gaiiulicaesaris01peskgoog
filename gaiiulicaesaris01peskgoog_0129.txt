98 DE BELLO CI VILI. [rm. 1.

Tarento, and Sipontum was near the site oi the modern Manlredonia.
Troops were also stationed at Hydruntum (Otranto), App. B. C. 11. 40.
proficiscitur] Caesar seems to have leit Brundisium 18 March; he
stopped at Beneventum a5th, Capua a6th, Sinuessa ayth, and had an
interview with Cicero at Formiae on the ossth3 cp. Cic. Art. rx 15 ὅ 6,
1651, 18, 1931. Plutarch Pomp. 62 makes Caesar visit Rome before
the investment of Brundisium, but in Caes. 35 lre puts the events in
their right order.
· a *comta senatu] in the absence ol the consuls, the tribunes M. Antonius
and Q. Cassius Longinus convoked the senate for 1 April outside the
pomerium, probably in the temple of Apollo outside the porto Carmen·
talis. “
iniurias] so in his speech to his troops at Ravenna (7 ᾖ 1) nennium
temporam iniurias inimicumne commemorat.
extraordinarium honorem] ‘extra-ordinary office', i.e. out of the
common order. This is a hit at Pompey who had held many offices
extra ordinent. Note that this word never means ‘wonderful’ ‘as-
tonishing’ as the word ‘extraordinary’ usually does nowadays.
eo...pateret] ‘had been content with that which lay open to every
citizen’.

3 latum] this was a privilegium (a law ol special application aflecting
only individuals) carried by the ten tribunes in 52, dispensing Caesar
from the obligation os a personal cauvas sor the consulship. This is the
heneficium populi mentioned below 5 gand 9 § a where see note.

Catone] cp. Liv. epit. 107 lex lato estut ratio absentis Caesaris in
petitione consulatus haberetur, invito et contradicente M. Catone.

extrahente] agrees with Catone, moro isan instrumental ablative
(‘by delay’ or ‘obstruction’), consuetudine is a madal ablative ‘ac·
cording to his old habit': cp. 33 § 3 sic triduum disputationibus
excusationibusque extrahitur. Cato wasa master os the art of Parlia·
mentary obstruction.

qui si...prohihuisset] Pompey’s vacillation in this matter was the
subject os much unsavourable criticism. He let the measure pass though
manifestly opposed to his own interests‚ but later on in the year by the
lex Pompeia de iure magistratuum he caused the original rule, which the
proposal ol the tribunes had set aside, tabe reaffirmed. The Caesarina
party, objecting to this, managed to have a special clause inserted
exempting Caesar from the operation of the rule. Suetonius lul. 28
says it was a mere oversight on Pompey's part (per oblivionem).

4 posternam] ‘longsuffering'.
