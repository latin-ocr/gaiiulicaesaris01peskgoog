90 DE BELLO CI VILI. [Lus. 1.

ab utroque latero] the side towards Brundisium and the side facing
the open sea, in other words, the sides facing up and down channel.

cratibus ac pluteis] ‘fascines and screens'3 the latter were breastworks
of wickerwork covered with raw hides: cp. 111. 245 r scaphas...cratibus
pluteisque contexit.

ro tabulatorum] ‘stom‘es ’ς these towers sometimes had 10 stories as in

B. G. vul. 41, and exceeded roo st. in height.

excitabat] ‘ran up': the word suggests hasty construction and is
elsewhere applied by Caesar to the erection of towers, B. G. 111. 14,
v. 40, v111. 9.

Caras. XXVI.

r adornabat] ‘proceeded to equip ’.

ibo] ‘ou them'=iu eis ; cp. 27 ἓ 3 and a similar use of eo 111. 2413* 1
eoque milites delectos imposuit where co=iu ear (scaphas).

curu torris] the use of the preposition is strange, and is scarcely
defended by such phrases as cum veste, cum telo etc.

tormentis] see note on 17 § 3.

omui genere telorum] ‘every kind of weapons’3 in B. G. vn. 4¹
nmltitudine...omms generis telorum the phrase seems to be reversed
‘weapons of every kind ’.

appellabat] ‘brought up close '.

a r'ta] ita thus followed by ut (⁶ in such a way that ¹) has something of
a concessive force: ‘Caesar though carrying on these operations did
not think that negotiations for peace ought to be dropped '.

Magium] from this remark and from the subsequent account of the
final closing of the negotiations we should naturally gather that Pompey
never sent back Magius at all, yet it is clear that he did so from
Caesar’s own letter to Oppius, Cic. Att.1x. 13A51 Pompeius est
Brundisii: misit ad me Ν. Magium de pace ; quae visa runt respondi:
so too Cicero says Att. rx. ¹3 5 8 Pompeius Ν. Magium de pace misit,
et tamen oppugnatur. KH would solve the contradiction by supposing
that Pompey had sent him back with instructions, to which Caesar had
replied, aad that then Pompey refrained from sending him on a second
mission. But this is pure guess-work. It is simplet to suppose that
Caesar here. whether from forgetfulness or deliberately, makes a false
statement.

ea res] his exertious to bring about an understanding: translate ,
freely ‘and although his frequent -attempts in this direction hindered'

etc.
