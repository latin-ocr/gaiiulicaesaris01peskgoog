xiv ¹ INTRODUCTION.

perpetually menaced the Roman possessions in Asia. That a
power such as Pompey's, not based on any hereditary right, nor
consolidated by time, nor indeed supported by vthe loyal ad-
herenee of a united people, should be exposed to the plots of an
ambitibus rival was only natural. Such a rival now arose in
the person of Caesar, the greatest of the Romans.

§ro Gaius Iulius Caesar.

Born probably in 102, of a noble family, connected by birth
with Marius and by marriage with Cinna, Gaius Julius Caesar
had passed an adventurous youth and had won the hearts of
the Roman people by his boundless liberality, his fascinating
address and his reckless audacity. But these showy qualities
concealed a resolute patience and fixity ol purpose that knew
how to bide its time. The long absence ol Pompey in the East ·
from 67 to 62 gave him scope for increasing his popularity and
maturing his plans. He became aedile in 65, and in 63 he was
elected Pontifex Maximus

511. T lte conspiracy os Catilina

ln the same year, 63, the conspiracy of Catiline broke out,
only to be promptly suppressed by the energy ol the consul
Cicero. This conspiracy “was not the work os the popular
party, and still less was it an nnselfish attempt at reform¹;'' it
was rather the attempt of a desperate adventurer to retrieve his
position by inciting the disaflected mob to a general rising.
How far Caesar was implicated in it cannot now be known, but it
is probable that he saw in the widespread popular discontent an
opening for his own ambitibus schemeS, and that he was ready,
if the conspiracy should gain ground, to shape the issue to suit
his own ends. At the trial he pleaded for the life of the
prisoners but his intervention was in vain. Some of the
leading conspirators were executed, the rest including Catiline
himself shortly after fell in battle, and tranquillity was lor a time
restored to Italy.
