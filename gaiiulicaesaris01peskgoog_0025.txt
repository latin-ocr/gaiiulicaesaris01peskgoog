xviii INTRODUCTION.

Cicero were evidently distracted with anxiety‚ not knowing to
which side to attach themselves. He exhorts the young Curio,
of whom he had a high opinion, to fit himself ior public life,
apparently in the vain hope that he might guide the state
through the troubles that threatened it¹. ln 52 he writes that
public allairs are getting into such a state that the most fortu-
