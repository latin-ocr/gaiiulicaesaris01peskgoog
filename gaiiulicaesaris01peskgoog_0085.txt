power by the coalition ol 60: cp. especially Cicero‘s letters to Atticus
11. 8, 9, 17, ar ἕ r de republica qur'degr rinmbtilirert tota periit atque
irre est miserior quam reliquisti, quod tum ridebatur eius modi dominatio
unitatem oppresusse quae iucunda esset multitudini, bonet autem ita
molesta, ut tamen sine pemicie ,· nune repente tanto in rdrb est omnibus,
ut quorsus emptura sit horreamus. From the instructive letter Fam.
1. 9 we find how difficult it was ior Cicero to keep on good terms with
both Pompey and Caesar, and how any approach that he might make
to either ol them gave offence to the other.

affinitatis] generally used oi connexion by marriage. Pompey
married Caesar’s daughter Julia in 59 ; she died in Sept. 54.

iniunxerat] ‘had imposed’, generally ol laying a burden on a
person; notice that it is bere followed bya quasi-persona] object quorum
maximamportem.

5 infamia] the discredit ol, i.e. attaching to, caused by, the two
legions.

Asiae Syriaeque] 1 know ol no parallel to this genitive alter itinere.
KH qu. 11. 32 ἕ 13 ltaliae fingam, but that is less harsh. Perhaps the
words should be omitted altogether. [The only parallel Ι have seen
quoted is Val. Flaccus t. 793 praesuaserat iter ,· but iter salutis, gloriae
dte. come very near3 so leti via &c- J. S. ie]

rem ad arma deduce] ‘that the question should be brought to the
arbitrament of war '. For the phrase cp. 5 5 5 res ad otium deduci,
B. G. v. 3¹ rem in summum periculum deducant, B. C. 1. 195 3.

Cure. V.

r turbate] this word is ol very rare occurrence.

extremi iuris] the sarthest or last of their rights, to which all the
others lead up, ie. the most important or fundamental: cf. below §3
illud extremum atque ultimum senatus consultum: but perhaps
extremum is merely a variation lor summurn=the rigour os their
authority.

intercessione] there is perhaps no need to omit this word: ‘no
opportunity is given the tribunes os retaining, hythe exercise ol their
veto (intercessione), the most fundamental ol their rights (viz. the right ol
exercising the veto) which L. Sulla had left them’. Sulla iu 88 and 81
took away most oi the privileges of the tribunes but left them the right
blinamma, subject however to strict limitations; cp. Liv. Epit. 89
tribunis plebis potestatem minuit rt onerer ius legum ferendunam adernit,·
