quibus...potuit]Jan. grd, 4th, 7th, are marked C (Comitialis dies) in
the Calendar, on which days it was against the rule sor a sitting os the
senate to be held, but in certain cases this rule could be dispensed with,
as eg. when the senate was summoned late in the day after the comitia
were over (Cic. Art. 1. 14 ὅ 5), or when the day in question was a market
day (nundinae) or an extraordinary holiday: soon this occasion there
was a session of the senate on the 7th as well ason Jan. rst, and, 5th,
6th. Mommsen, Staatsrecht 111. a, p. 922 soll.

r extro urbem] or, as it is elsewhere expressed‚ outside the pomerium,
cp. Dion xm. 3 ὕστερον δὲ ἔξω τοῦ renuptae πρὸς αὐτὸν τὸν Πομπήιον
ἐλθόντες ταραχήν τε εἶναι ἔγνωσαν κ.τ.λ. The precise nature os the
pommam is disputed but it may be taken in a general way to mean the
bouudary line os a town or settlement, the ground within which was
consecrated and so marked off srom the surrounding ager. lt originated,
according to Varro Lingua Latina v. 143, in the old Etruscan habit of
drawing a line round a new settlement witha plough aud a yoke of
oxen; the trench cut by the plough was called the sessa and the lineos
earth thrown upon the inner side the murus, then the line or strip
of ground behind, ie. inside (according to some, outside) the wall was
called the pos-merium or pomerium (cp. pomeridmnus); sometimes the
word denoted the whole of the interior space, so that pomerium and
urbs were almost equivalent. As the state grew the pomerium had to
be moved farther outwards‚ and this was done by Sulla and by Caesar.

The reason sor the senate meeting outside the walls was to secure
the presence os Pompey who as proconsul and armed with the inmerentia
could not enter the city. The place where they met was the temple of
Apollo built about 430 ne. just outside the porta Carmentalem cp. Cic.
