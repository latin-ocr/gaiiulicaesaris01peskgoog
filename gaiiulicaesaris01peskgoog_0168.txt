carr. uxrx.-uxx11.] NOTES. 137

the immediately surrounding country was level, and the hill was
apparently a small and isolated one. Round it swanned Caesar’s
cavalry.

exemnibus partibus] ‘from all quarters’r two Mss omit ex, but it
is doubtful whether cineribus partibus could here be used in the sense of
‘on all accounts’3 cp, Cic. Fin. v. 93 vitam omnibus partibus plus
habere semper beni quam mali.

1 legate] these three classes of officers, legates, centurious and military
tribunes, formed the usual council of war.

3 multis rebus] ‘in many ways ’.

signa misisse] ‘had exhibited signs'; cp. Verg. Georg. 1. 119 haud
obscura cadens mittet tibi signa Booten Lucr. 1. 874 fruges...mittere
signum sanguinis: I hardly understand why Madvig Adv. 11. 165
objects to misisse here and wants to read dedisse or iam dedisse.

decederent] ‘were not coming down ’, notice change of tense from
subvenissent.

regna servarent] owing to the narrow space the several legions were
crowded together in confusion instead of being drawn up in line under
their own colours.

4 iniquitatem lece] this phrase, which is frequent in Caesar, means
‘inequality of site' and is used where, of two opposing forces, one
occupies a position of advantage, in respect of elevation, over the
other.

alique loco] 1 see no reason for altering aliqunto aequo as Madvig
does Adv. 11. 265, with the further change of tamen to hm. The
implied argument of the soldiers is ‘granted that it may not be wise to
sight while Afranius occupies the hill, yet he must corne down soon, and
then we shall certainly find seme place to fight in ’0

CHAP. LXXII.
