and discrepancy to be met with in Caesar’s narrative; probably the
resistance offered at Firmum was slight and easily overcome: (ii) if
Fr'rruo be read, exprrlso lentulo need not necessarily mean ‘driven from
Firmum ’; why should it not mean ‘driven from the country' i.e. from
Picenum, the district with which the greater part of the last chapteris
concerued? (iii) ibi need not refer back to Firmo. Surely as Caesar has
last spoken of Lentulus, ibi might very naturally refer to the place
where Lentulus was, ie. Asculum. KH suppose that Caesar wrote
oppido, which occurs in the margin osone us, and that the copyist,
remembering the passage in Cicero’s letters, altered it to Firmo. But
such erudition does not accord with what we know of the ways of
copyists. Itis sar more probable that the copyist of this MS knowing
that Lentulus was at Asculum altered Firmo to oppido. The Aldine
edition has Asculo. Cp. Lucan 11. 468 depellitur arce Lentulus Asmlea.

Corfinium contendit] M. Stoffel asserts that the route taken by
Caesar and by Vibullius lay through Teramo, Penne, Torre dei Passeri,
Bussi, and Popoli. He supposes Caesar to have lest Asculum on
ιο Feb. and to have arrived at Corfinium on 15 Feb, a date which is
supported by other considerations.

would cross it by the modern town of Popoli which is just three miles
from the site oi Corfinium.

1 ad Pompeium] Pompey was at this time at Luceria ; cp. Cic. Att.
vlu. ἓ 1 (15 Feb.) where he says Pompey has just written to him and
urged him to go to Luceria where he will be safer than anywhere else:
and in Att vm. 6 we read that the praetor Sosius brings a copy οἱ
a letter from Pompey to the consuls announcing the receipt on the r7th
ol aletter from Domitius; this must be the dispatch spoken ol in the
text, no doubt sent by Domitius on the 15th the date os Caesar’s arrival
before Corfinium. In the next letter (Art vm. 7) Cicero says “Only
one discreditable act remains ior our iriend Pompey, and that is to
relose to succour Domitius. But you say ‘no one doubts but that he
