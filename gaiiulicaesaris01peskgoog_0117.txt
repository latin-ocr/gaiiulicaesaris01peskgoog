Histonium (Vasto, on the Adriatic coast) to Teanum in Apulia on the
south bank ol the Frento. From thence he would probably go by
Arpi (Cic. Att. IX. 3 ἕο), Canusium, Barium (Bari), Egnatia (near
Monopoli), and so to Brundisium. 1 dare not follow General Gdler in
giving the exact stage sor each day, or in stating at what part of the
journey the troops were halted sor a day's rest t

receiving Domitins' letter on the 17th (Cic. Art. V111.6 5 a, ra D ξ r)
announcing the investment ol Corfinium. It is not therefore strictly
correct to say that Pompey lest Luceria ‘on learning of these events
which had happened at Corfinium ’, lor when he lest he could not have
had news ot more than the first two days at most ol the siege.

Canusium] Canosa just S. ol the Aufidus (orante). Pompey let‘t
Canusium on the arst; cp. Cic.Att.vr11. 145 1, 1x. 1 ἓ r.

erudisium] the well-known Brindisi, then, as nou, a great portos
embarlration. Pompey arrived there 25 Feb, cp. cic. An. tx. 10 §8
K. Mart, cum ille quintum iam diem Brundisii esset.

a capras] Pompey now organises his new levies. It will be remem-
bered that the only regular troops he had with him were the two
legions taken from Caesar: ol these, ¹4 cohorts had been in camp at
Luceria, two had been sent on to Brundisium under Metellus Scipio,
and the remaining four were at Canusium: cp. Cic. Au. vul. 3 ἕ 7,
1an§a, raetia.

3 L. dioniius] sumamed Torquatus, one of the praetors ol 49.

Alba] the Marsic Alba Fucentia (15 ἓ 7). It seems strange that
Caesar should have advanced lrom Corfinium leaving a hostile garrison
ol six cohorts behind him. Moberley takes this to be the Alba in
Latium, but “Alba in Latium was no place at this time 3 had the site
oi old Alba been meant Caesar would have written ex monte Albana or
something ol the sort.” J. S. u.

Rutilius Lupus] Cic. Att. lx. 1 5 a (written 6 March) urbem quidem

Later on Lupus was holding Achaia sor Pompey B'. C. 111. 56.

Tarracina] Terracina, formerly called Anxur. in Latium on the
coast between cape Circello and Gaeta.
