132 aa aaran alvear. [nn. 1.

latin and was supplanted by uas. The word denotes all the various
apparatus ol a camp; tents, baggage, etc. According to Polybius vt.
40, when a camp was broken up three signals were giveu3 at the first
the packiug up began ς at the second, the baggage ready packed was
placed ou the waggons or beasts, and at the third the army began to
move. The word conclamari must refer to the human voice and not to
the sound ol an instrument, cp. 111. 105 § 3 territus exercitus clamor et
signorum sanus: no doubt when the trumpet sounded at the general’s
headquarters the necessary orders were given in a loud voice by the
officers all over the camp to their men, and it is to this shouting that the
word applies. For the whole expression cp. 111. 37 5 4 ne conclamatis
quidem vasis, 38 ξ 1 vasisque militari more conclamatis: often we find
vasa colligere used of moving camp, as in Liv. xxr. 47. Probably the

order was g'rven in the words vasa colligite, or simply vasa.
exaudito clamare] ‘having caught the sound of the shouting': lor this,

the usual meaning os exaudire, cp. B. G. vt. 39 with my note.

ant] ‘or else ἐ aut ne marks the alternative more clearly than neue.

3 postera die] presumably τό July.

hac idem] a similar reconnaissance is made by Caesar.

L. Decidius Saxa] tribune tac. 43, when he left the city to join
Antony. He took a prominent part subsequently iu the civil war, and
while serving as Antony's legate iu Syria in 40 was defeated and slain by
an irruption ol the Parthians, who were assisted (quifuror scelernm! as
Florus says 11. 18 § 4)=by the Roman Labienus. According to another
account he committed suicide. Cicero often speaks of him with ab·
horrence in the Philippics, cp. Phil. xl. ra accedit Saxa nescioquis, quem
nobis Caesar ex ultima Celtiberia tribunum plebis dedit, castrorum autea
metator, nunc, ut sperat, urbis.

4 quinque...campesuis] ‘the next intervening 5 miles afforded a march
over easy ground ’. The word campestris must not be too strictly
interpreted; there was no level plain in the neighbourhood, but the
ground might be called campestn's as opposed to the rugged mountainous
district lying 5 miles south.

excipere] see note on 65 ἓ 3.

qui] we should expect uter ‘whichever ol the two ', asin 70§ r utri
prius angustias niaritesque occuparent: cp. B. G. v. 44 hi...contreuersias
habebant, quinam antq‘erretur.

nihii...negotii] ‘no trouble ’, ‘an easy task': ‘it would be an easy
rask lor the one who should first occupy these defiles to keep the enemy

at bay'.
