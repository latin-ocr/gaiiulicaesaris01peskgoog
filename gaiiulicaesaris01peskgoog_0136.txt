ol M. Antonius in the battle in which Catiline was killed, ne. 6a; Sall. '
cat. 59, 603 Cic. p. Sest. 12.

Varro] M. Terentius Varro, best known sor his extraordinary eru·
dition and his voluminous works, of which unfortunately the greater
part have perished, was a strong supporter ol the senatorial party, but
alter the decisive battle at Pharsalia he surrendered to Caesar and
passed the rest ol his lise in retirement and study. At this date he was
about 66. The destruction oi his valuable library at Casinum by
Antony is referred to by cicero Phil. 11. S 103.

Hepaniam citmbrem] it is perhaps impossible to give the exact
limits os this province at this period, but it may be roughly described as
comprising the whole oi the north-eastem portion oi Spain from the
Bay ol Biscay to the Sierra de Morena (saltus Castulonensis) and
Cartagena.

alter] notice that alter refers to Varro and tertius to Petreius though
they had previously been mentioned in reverse order: this is a mark of
hasty writing (KH).

ulteriorem] this province comprised most or all os the rest of Spain
not included in Hispania citerior; it had two main divisions‚ one called
Baetica, that is, the country between the saltus Castulonensis, with its
south-eastem extensions, and the river Anas (Guadiana); the other
called Lusitania, for which see below. At a later period Lusitania was
made a distinct province, the name Hispania ulterior being reserved lor
the abridged province of Baetica.

terrenum] the Vettones occupied a district about covering the
provinces of Caceres and Salamanca, between the Durius (Douro)
and Ibe Anas.

Lusitaniam] the third main division ol Roman Hispania, comprising
the country bounded by ὼε Durius, the sea, and the Anas. The
extreme north-western comer oi Spain, Gallaecia and Asturia, may have
been considered at this time as belonging to Lusitania.

a ad Afranium] Afranius was stationed at llerda (Lerida) on the
Sicoris (Segre).
