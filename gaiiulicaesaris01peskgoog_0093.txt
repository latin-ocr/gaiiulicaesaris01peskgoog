62 DE BELLO CI VJLt [ιιι. ι.

nudata...tamen] nudata potestate is a concessive abl. absolute
‘though be had stripped ' followed by tamen; cs. Cic. Au. vn. 18 5 a
Caesarem quidem L. Caesare cnm mandatis de pace missa tanuen aiunt
acerrime deleetm habere ‘although he had seut ’.

4 videatm] ‘is supposed to bave restored ⁹, ‘has the reputation ot

having restored ’.

dona...lrabuerint] tbe privilege of inviolability. The text is probably
corrupt.

5 quotienscumque] the decree was passed in the years ιιι, roo, 83,

63, ⁵²·

qua...nacat'us] the general effect ol the sanatus consultum ultimum is
thus summarined by Sallust, Cat. 29 ea potestas per· senatum man
Romano magistratui maxima permittitur, exereitum parare, bellurn
gerere, coercere omnibns erodes sacras atque cives, danti militiaeque
imperinm atque iudicium summum tabae: aliter sine papuli iussn
nullius earum rernm consuli ius est. With Caesar's expression cp.
Liv. Epit. (ιι ex senatres consulto uocata ad arma papula ,· Cic. de orat.
11. ¹32 cum ex senatus consulta ad arura uocasset.

in pernicsbsis legibus] this would apply to the years 123 and roo when
radical changes in the law had been proposed by C. Gracchus and
1.. Apuleius Saturninus. Whether their laws were really perniciosae is
another matter.

in ui tribunicia] this would also apply to thesaure two years. In
tbe case ol Tib. Gracchus uc. 133 apparently no such decree was
passed. ‘⁸ The murder of Tib. Gracchus and his 300 tonowers had not
even a semblance os legality. Plut. Tib. Gracch. 19 distinctly says that
the consul Scaevola refused to allow the SCtnm to be passed. Hence
caresulem languentem in Cic. T. D. 1v. 5¹3 ingerenda re segnior p.
Domo 91 ι the other accounts in Val. Max.111. a 17 all 1 think agree.”
J. s. n.

in secessione papuli...occupatis] as in ιιι when the Aventine was
occupied by an armed multitude, Liv. Epit. 61. Caesar may also be
thinking oi the well-known secessibnes papuli in 34² when M. Valerius
Corvus was appointed dictator, aud in 287 when Q. Hortensius was
appointed, sor, though the appointment os a dictator was not quite
the same thing as the senatus consultum ultimum by which the senate
empowered the higher magistrates to secure the safety oi the state, yet
tbe practical etl'ect was much the same, ie. the ordinary laws were
suspended. The dictatorship was not employed after roo till revived
by Sulla in 82.
