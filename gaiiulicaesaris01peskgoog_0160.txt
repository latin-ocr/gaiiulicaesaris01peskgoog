cape. uxr-cxiv] NOTES. 129

Cnar. LXIII.

a relinquebatur] ‘no other course was left for Caesar but to annoy’ etc.
This use of the word is common in Caesar, cp. 29 ἓ 2.
male haberet] ‘ injure '‚ ‘annoy’ r male haberi is a suggested reading
in 81 ς 5.
carperet] ‘harass’ by repeated attacks; the word seems to have been
a regular term of warfare: cp. Lucan 1v. 155 iamque agmina neuma
carpit eques, where agmina stemma is the sameas Caesar’s nouissimum
agmen.
uiuus] ‘his own’ bridge, opposed to the bridge at Ilerda by which
the enemy had crossed.
habebat] ‘involved ³.
3 eum] ‘although’.
de tertia vigilia] reckoning the night at this time of the year (towards
the end of July, corresponding to middle or end of June) as lasting from
8 to 4, the time here denoted would be ra to a am.
merare] ‘to hinder (theml’, used without an object expressed3 but
if, with Paul, we transpose iter to follow impedire, then of course e'ter
will be the object of both verbs.

Cure. LXIV.

r superioribus lacis] perhaps the hill of Malpas‚ close to the hill of
Gardeny and to Caesar’s camp.
sustinere] I print the passage as it stands in the mss, but it needs
correction. KH's translation, bisweilen h'alt der N achtrab Stand‚ wird
aber durchbrochen etc„ scarcely represents the latin: the insertion of uix
or aegre before or after nonuunquam would restore sense and would
closely correspond to Β. G. 1v. 32 sues ab hostibus premi atque aegre

ueste'nere antaraduerte't. Every careful reader will notice how often
Caesar reproduces his own phrases. sustinere meaning ‘to hold out' is

fairly common. Mr E. S. Thompson suggests sustineri ‘to be pulled
f ί 2
upeitqiieelciutihrumpe] ‘and even separated’ (‘broken off ') ‘from the
rest'.
a inferri regna] ‘standards are advanced ⁹, i.e. for a charge.
universarum] ‘ina body ', when they were no longer interruptae.
The whole army probably took part in these charges on the cavalry, not
merely all the cohorts of the rearguard.
conuersas] crcsn’s cavalry.
