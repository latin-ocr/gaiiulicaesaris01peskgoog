Α PPENDIX. 159

B. C. 11. 2 3 ἓ 1. 37 ἓ 4, but there the iorces ol Domitius are included.
Curio only took two legions with him to Sicily, hence read Il with
Ciacconina and most recent editors.

5 impuratissimis all MSS, except thatl has imperitissimus as a corree-
tion3 Ι agree with Meusel in thinking that imparatissimus should be
read. The corruption is easily accounted ior by assimilation to the
preceding ablative.

01 3 I retain the reading oi the ntss in terra.

82 5 quodab altero non postulareuthl‚ alterorum postularent a b; the varia·
tions point to the loss oi some word between allero and postularent.

6 legibus Mss; Aldus restored legionibus.

88 4tempus mittat all ross except Ο which has omittot,· the editors
generally accept Nipperdey’s amittat: Paul dimittat.

84 1 missum a Pompeio Mss; most editors atter Aldus write mr'ssum in
Hispaniam, ep. 38 ἓ r. Nipperdey reiers to 111. aa §r irom which it
appears that Milo who was in exile at Massilia had received instruc·
tions t'rom Vibullius. But this iu itsell would not be an argument
against the words ln Hispaniam, since a person on his way lrom
Italy to Spain might well pass through Massilia. I prefer however
to retain the reading oi the uss on the ground that maruno, ‘had
been despatched ⁹, ‘ had been sent on a mission ³. would make sullicient
sense without the addition ol the destination.

n Sigili MSS, the s having adhered lrom quos.

4 acl se vocaverant Mss3 read perhaps mmaoerant as Paul suggests.

5 iu omnibus castellis a f h, ex 0 (prima manu), l omits the preposition.
So Paul.

aa 3 partes duas hls3 this seems more lorcible than duas porres the
reading ol a, adopted by most editors.

4olter lello victas Gallias Mss; most editors adopt the conjecture oi
Glandorpius vr‘etos Sallyas, which would seem to require that the
second alter should refer to Pompeius though he is mentioned first.
Madvig proposed alter bello outa Gallia eodem tribuerit, which Paul
adopts with the substitution os alra attra'buerr't lor eadem tribuen't. 1
accept this reading in delault ol a better.

80 3 urbr's accidant Mss3 the editors rightly urbis, si ocaaat.

aa r The words tribus legionibus alter ulteriorem do not occur in any ms
but are necessary to the sense. They were lirst inserted by Nipperdey.
The omission is easily accounted tor by the similarity oi the words
citeriorem and ulteriorem.

3 totius mss, a mistalre due to Lusitaniae being regardedasngen'n'm.
