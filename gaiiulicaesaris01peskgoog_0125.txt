exact difference between a scapha anda linter, but probably the former

Picena] these would be merchant vessels belonging to Ancona and

other small ports on the coast of Picenum.
frelo] the Sicilian strait, which, as the strait best known to the

Romans, was often called fretum without any addition. KH suppose

that Caesar meant the ships which had conveyed the troops of Domitius ·

to Sicily.
impeditum] ‘fraught with hindrances'. ,

3 veterem exercitum] it will be remembered that Pompey had a veteran
army of 7 legions in Spain, the two Spanisb provinces having been
assigned to him for 5 years from 1 Jan. 55 by the lex Trebonr'a.

altera] tbe reference is to Hispania citerior, where, in conjunctior
with Q. Caecilius Metellus the governor of Hispania ulterior, Pompey
had brought the Sertorian war to a successful conclusion in 72. Alter
the death of Sertorius most of the towns of bitber Spain voluntarily
surrendered to Pompey, who doubtless did his best to restore prosperity
to the afflicted country and so earned the gratitude of the inhabitants.

Cnnr. XXX.

1 Hispaniam] “Caesar’s resolution to go to Spain arose from an
almost instinctive feeling in a Roman general, prevailing since the
time of the Second Punic war, leading thern to consider Spain as
important as Italy itself. See Arnold, Hist. Rome, vol. 111. p. 81;
where this point is well brought out '' (Moberley).

duunrviris] see note on 23 5 4: the duumviri are probably tbe two
I Vviri iure dicundo there mentioned who may have been also termed
IIviri iure dicundo. As Dr Reid says, these magistrates were probably
called duovira', the form duumviri (duum being an older form related to

duorum as nummum to nummorum) having perhaps been expanded
‘vm the abbreviation Ilvr'ri.
