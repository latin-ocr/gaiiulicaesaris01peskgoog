carr. xv. xvn] NOTES ‚ 75

(quas potest contrahit). It is possible that there may be some corruption
in the MSS, and il there is not, the discrepancy need not surprise us
much, considering the difficulty ol communication in those days and the
absence of official documenta.

6 Dantitium Ahenobarbum] cp. note on 6 ἓ 5. According to Appian
11. 32, 38 he brought with him to Corfinium in January a force ol 4000
men which he had apparently raised with a view to his governorship of
Gaul, to which he had been appointed as Caesar's successor. This soree
was divided into ra cohorts, see note on 17 ξ a.

Corfinium] this important stronghold was situated in the country oi
the Paeligni on the site os the modern town of Pentima, in a plain about
1100 leet above the sea-level, surrounded by losty mountains. It was on
the via Valeria, and the river Aternus (Aterno or Pescara) flowed to the
north os it. A lew miles south was Sulmo (solmone), the birthplace os
Ovid.

niagnu's itineribus] ‘forced marclres'. vegetius, de re militari, seems
to reclcon 23 miles a good day’s march. The distance t'rom Asculum
to Corfinium is 165 kilometres which, assuming that the march occupied
four days (Stoffel 1. rao), would give about 25} miles a day. They
probably reached Corfinium 8 F eb.

7 Alba] now Albe, a town of the Marsi, about ao miles westward of
Corfinium. The abl. (unless we read the locative Albae) must be
taken with coegerat ‘had collected (and brought) from Alba ’3 then the
words ex Marsis et Paelignar's state oi what tn'bes the troops consisted;
to this is further added fim'ta'mir ab regionibus expressing the neigh-
bourhood lrom which they were drawn, ‘from the neighbouring parts ’.
The sentence is rather awkwardly worded, but it does not improve it
to alter ex to ct as KH and Doberenz do.

Cnnr. XVI.

t recepto Firmo] cp. Cic. Att. vul. ra 1351 (Pompey to Domitius)
aram illa causa, quam mihi Vibullius scribit, levat est, te propterea mo·
ratum esse, quod audierat Caesarem Firmo progressum in Castrum
Tncentinum venisse. Taking these two passages together Ido not see
how one can doubt that Caesar did, whether in person or not, occupy
Firmum and Truentum on his way to Asculum. KH object to reading
Ili'rmo here sor three reasons, but (i) the alleged divergence between
this statement and the general tenor os 15 ἕξ 1, a (see my note) must
not be pressed too rnuch considering the undoubted instances simne
