more limited in extent than thatoi the consul or praetor, but was

paludatique] wearing the paludamentum or scarlet cloak appropriated ,
to generals holding the tumetium.

uotis nuncupata] ‘alter offering vows’. Festus explains r‘aua
nunccupata dicuutur quae consules praetores cram in provinciana perfi-
ciscuntur faciunt,¹ ea in tabulas praesentibus multis reseruntur‘: cp.
Livy, xxr. 63 C. Flaminium fugisse ne...auspr'cata profectus in
Capitolium ad vota nuncupanda paludatus indacum lictoribus in
provinciam iret.

quod ante id tempus accedat numquam] this statement is so demon·
strably arrd even ludicrously untrue that VosS, Nipperdey arrd others
would eject the words altogether. But Caesar who elsewhere in this
narrative shows a disregard lor truth no doubt relied on his readers
having short memories, arrd I do not see why he should be less likely
to make a false statement, if it suited his purpose to do so, than a
modern Christian statesman. Before the time oi Sulla it had been the
regular thing lor the consuls to leave the city during their term ol office,
and although in 81 the lex Cornelia ,de provinciis enacted that they
should not leave it till the expiration of their year, yet between that
date and 49 there had been five or ,six instances ot the rule being
contravened. Caesar however sor his own purposes chooses to ignore
these. The subject is sully discussed by Mommsen, Rechtsfrage‚ p. a9
tort, arrd by Nipperdey, Quaestiones, 128 toll, and in an article in the
Rheinisches Museum, xv11. 186² reprinted in his Opuscula, p. 4²² foll.
[lt was the going in arrd out of the city arrd yet retaining the imperium
which Caesar declared unparalleled. He would never have said that

7 priuata] 1 take this word to reler to the consuls and praetore just
mentioned who were on the point of leaving the city attended by their
lictors and with all the insignia ol authority. Caesar invidiously calls
them pulsati because they had not had the imperium properly conterred
on them. KH and Doberenz think that the procoumles ad urbem 5 ἓ 3
are meant.

vetustates] ‘former times ', ‘the past’„

8 mzrna'ripia's] ‘municipal towns’ whose inhabitants possessed the cr'vi-

tas sine suffragio. ¹ Α
