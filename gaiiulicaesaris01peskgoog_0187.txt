Madvig and bleusel prefer consul. After pessumum h has se,· as
Caesar does not elsewhere omit the reflexive pronoun after negare, Ῑ
retain it here.

7 a The uss have armis after onereb, probably a mere slip. Hotoman
cj. sine armis.

4dona uss, bona Victorius. Dr Reid says ‘perhaps tribum‘s is the
right reading, tri having been lost by collision with tur and contrac-

remittunt: KH ptr eos mittunt.

tt a quem diem MSS, Paul quam as more in accordance with Caesar’s
usage, dies when meaning a date being usually feminine.
