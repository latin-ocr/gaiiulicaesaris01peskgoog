xx INTRODUCTJON.

proposal was then put in an altered form, that Pompey should
disarm ; this was rejected by a large majority. lt was then again
put in its original form, that both generals should disann simul·
taneously, and was thereupon carried by the large majority of 370
to 22¹. The execution of this decree was hindered by the Pom-
peiam, who thereby put themselves in the wrong by resisting
the expressed will of the senate. Meanwhile in view of Caesar's
threatening attitude on the frontier and the impossibility of a
satisfactory settlement of the points at issue, it was felt to be
necessary that immediate steps should be taken for the defence
of the capital. The task was naturally assigned to Pompey, who
began to raise levies and organise the forces of the common·
wealth. Curio feeling that war was inevitable lled to Caesar.
But Caesar had apparently not yet abandoned all hope oi com-
promise, or perhaps it would be more correct to say that he
determined to put the Pompeians as clearly as possible in the
wrong. He sent an ultimatum by the hands of Curio, offering
to disband his troops if Pompey would do the same. This
was brought before the senate on 1 Jan. 49. At this point

the history of the Civil War opens. How the last attempt at
negotiation sailed and the long impending war broke out may be
read in Caesar's own narrative.

one's way with any certainty through the maze of confused and con·
flicting accounts that have been handed down to us os the debates and
divisions in the senate during this critical time.
