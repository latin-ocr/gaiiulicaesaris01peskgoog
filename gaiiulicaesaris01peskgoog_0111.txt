ao Da Burro crvsar. [aa. ι.

eodem scre tempore] this would be on the 19th, Pompey having
received Domitius’ letter on the 17th.

Cura. XIX. .

r litteris] fortunately this very letter written at Luceria 17 Feb. is
preserved for us in Cic. Att. vni. ra D. The tenor of it is—‘What I
expected has happened. Caesar avoids a pitched battle, and has shut
yon up to prevent my wavering legions from being strengthened by the
accession of your loyal troops. 1 must not risk the iortunes os the state
by engaging Caesar, nor have 1 all my reinsorcements. Get sree and join
meis you can’. Previous letters had passed between the two generals.
Pompey wrote rr Feb, expressing his surprise that Domitius had
abandoned his original intention of joining him, and urging him to do so
at once: on 16 Feb. he writes again acknowledging two letters from
Domitius, both probably written on the 14th, in the first os which
Domitius had said that he was keeping an eye on Caesar’s movements
and would join Pompey as soon as he could; in the second he urges
Pompey to come to him at once, which Pompey says he dare not do
with his untrustworthy forces.

consilzb] ‘council ol war': consilium may mean ‘council’ as well as
‘counsel’, but concilium only ‘council’.
parent] supply ut from the preceding ne.
a arcano] a rare word, only here in Caesar.
oratzbne] ‘his words’‚ ‘his way oi talking '.
coruuesset] the indicative would be more usual ; the subjunctive
marks a kind os oratio obliqua, the sect being put as viewed by the men
in the camp.
multumque. . sugeret] this clause, connected with the preceding by que,
is itself divided into two parts multum...colloqueretur and concilia...
jugera which are not connected by a copula z translate the latter ‘while
avoiding councils’ etc.

3 neque suo consiltb] so Cicero says Att. vlu. ra 5 6 omnino culpam
omnem Pompeius in Domitium confert.

4 fuisset] ‘should have offered itself'.

opprilz] there is no need to alter the position of this worda ‘by the
bloclrade and by the investment os the town ².

fiebat] ‘it was being brought about¹; not quite the same as factum art.
There is some trace of carelessness in this use osfieri and fiebat in the

samesentence.
