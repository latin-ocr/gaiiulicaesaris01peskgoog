assumptions on the fact of his being named Cornelius, as 14 years before
another Cornelius Lentulus, on the strength of some real or pretended
maele, had claimed to be the third Cornelius who should hold supreme
sway in Rome, the other two having been Cinna and Sulla: Sall. Cat.
47. Doubtless many Romans at this time aspired ιο military supremacy:
cp. Cicero's expression about Pompey Αιι. ιιι. ιο 5 6, ito sullaturit eius
anianus et proscripturit iamdiu.
3 spes provinciae atoue exercituum] above spe exercitus ac provinciarum,

but there is probably no particular reason for the change of number.
- necessitudine] cp. note on ι 5 4.

riediriorum metus] though Plutarch (Pomp. 55) speaks of him as
γένους ἕνεκα και δόξης ἄμεμπτος, yet he was threatened with a prosecution
for bribery in connection with the consular electioris of 5a and was only
saved by the intervention of Pompey his son-in-law: cp. Dion xl.. 5¹
denor Σκιπίωνα πενθερόν τέ ot ὄντα tul δεκασμοῦ αἰτίαν ἔχοντα προσει-
λετο...παρ’ αὐτοῦ (Πομπηίου) τήν τε ὑπατείαν καὶ τὸμὴ κατηγορηθῆναι
ἀπέλαβε. iudr'ciorum metus does not mean ‘fears as to the constitution
of the ›courts of justice‘ (Moberley).
. ostentatio suc] there is probably some corruption in the text as it is
difficult to make potentium a genitive after ostmtatr'o: ‘adulatio is the
flattery of Scaevola's friends, ostentatio sui thevanity which made him
accessible to it: potentium seems an error for potentia eorum ’. J. s. ιι.

4 quod neminem volebat] cp. the well known line of Lucan 1. 125 nec

quemquam interferre potest Caesarve priorem Pompeiusve parem Florus
ιι. ¹3 and ¹4 nec ille (Pompeius) ferebat parem, nec hic superiorem.
Pompey’s arrogance and misplaced confidence in himself are constantly
referred to, cp. Plut. Pomp. 57.

totum] for this personal use of totus cp. B. G. vr. 5 totus et mente et
oninro in bellum...insistit, Cic. Fam. ιι. ι 3 iam me Pompei totum esse
scis.

cum cornorunidus inimr'cis dra] the sentence is obscure and the
commentators have little or nothing to say about it. Caesar seems to
mean that Pompey had reconciled himself with persons who had
professed a common enmity for himself and Caesar, after causing the
burden of their enmity to fall chiefly on the latter during the time that
the two were connected by marriage, ie. nc. 59—54. Caesar is probably
thinking chiefly of Cato and Cicero, as well as of the great body of
respectable persons whom Pompey’s want of tact when at the head of
affairs in Rome had so far alienated that they looked with suspicion
not only on himself but also on Caesar with whom he was assoe'xaseb'm
