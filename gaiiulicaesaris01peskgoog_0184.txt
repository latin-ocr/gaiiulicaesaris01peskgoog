Narbonensis.
4 sacramentum dicere] cp. 23 g 5, 11. 28 ἕ n.

Crine. LXXXVII.

p. 46. ι quae se'ret] this clause is added as explanatory of quod quisque...
arreisoii. Caesar remembem, as it were, that he could not undertake
to restore all that they had lost in war, and therefore limits his promise
by the addition oi these words, ‘those things at least that are in the
hands of his own soldiers '. .

eir, qui amiserant] ‘to' the losers’: the phrase is regarded as
equivalent to a noun, hence there is no need for the subjunctive3 ‘a
short relative clause, especially when it immediately follows a demon·
strative, is osten constructed independently of oratio obliqua, being
regarded as a mere epithet' Kennedy L. G. ξ ¹93·

aequasaeto aestimatione] ‘at a fair valuation’. ,

a ad Caesarem in ius oelierunl] ¹ they went to Caesar to adjudicate ι
cp. cic Verr. ιν. 147 cum ad praetorem in ius adimemus.

3 cum rependium.‚flagitarenturJ ‘when Petreius and Afranius were
ashed for the pay’, ‘when the pay was demanded of Petreius' etc.
The construction implies a double accusative with, flagitare as in B. G.
1. 16 cotidie Caesar Aeduos frunemtum..flagr'tare.

cuius...dicerent] ‘on their saying that the day lor it bad not yet
come ’: cuius represents curu eius, hence the subjunctive.

4 reliquas] this cannot mean the remaining four ol his six legions, for
we learn srorn 11. ¹9 ἓ 1 that Caesar despatched two legions under Q.
Cassius to Hispania ulterior where Varro was assuming a threatening
attitude: by reliquas then must be meant the two that remained after
the departure of Cassius. Caesar himself started southward sor Corduba
with 600 horsemen a day or two before Cassius.

Q. Fusium Calenum] mentioned B. G.V111. 39. He played an
active part in the civil war, and was consul with P. Vatinius for the
last three months ol' 47. Lange Rom. Alt. 111. 436.
