cuna. xiv. xiva] NOTES. 115

his camp followed the bank of the river and entered the town by way of
the stone bridge (not of course aver the bridge, as they were on the town
side of the river) and so passed through the town to the gates opening
on to the above-mentioned slope.
integri] for this antithesis of integri and defessi ‘fresh' and ‘ex-

hausted' cp. B. G. v. 16, vu. 41, 48, 853 B. C. 111. 40, 94.

P· 26. 8 ut...reeiperet] the ut clause is explanatory olfacere, as in 44

CHAP. XLVI.

1 tue cum esset modo] for the order cp. 80 5 r tali dum pugnatur enada
liaris quinque] ablative of ‘time throughout which’, a development
of the commones usage of ‘time in the course of which’, Roby5 1184:
cp. 47 ᾗ 3 nostri...quad quinque liaris praelium sustinuissent ; Β. G. 111.
5 cum cam amplius haris sex continenter pugnaretur.

and Livy, but only here in Caesar.

4 ex primo tutata] to understand this aright one must have some idea
