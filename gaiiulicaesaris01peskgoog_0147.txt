116 DE BELLO CI VILI. [niu. 1.

officers called centuriones, 'one called prior and the other posterior.
There were thus 6ο centurious in a legion, and the lowest in rank was
the posterior of the soth maniple of the hastati, the decimus hastatus
posterior, while the highest was the prior of the first maniple of the

triarii, or, as he was usually called for brevity, the primipilus (pilus
meaning triarius). obiter Marius the old order of battle was given up

but the legion was divided as before into to cohorts, each cohort
containing 3 maniples, and, as before, each maniple had its prior and its
posterior centurio. In order to distinguish the different centurions the
old names were retained, and the 6 centurions of any cohort, say the
first, would be thus designated :-

⁴ prior and posterior hastatus

prior and posterior princeps primae cohortis.
prior and posterior pilus

The lowest in rank of the 60 centurions was the posterior hortatus of the
roth cohort, and the highest was the prior pilus of the first cohort, or,
as he was usually called, the primipilus. Apparently a man rose by
successive steps from the lowest to the highest place3 thus he might
begin by being posterior hastatus of the roth cohort, then posterior
hastatus of the 9th, and so on to the rst cohort, after which he would
be posterior princeps of the 10 cohorts in order, beginning with the 1oth,
then posterior triarius in the same order, after this he would go through
the to cohorts first as prior leastatus, then as prior princeps, then as
prior triarius, reaching the highest point as prior triarius (or primi·
pilus) of the first cohort. Another well supported view is thata man
did not go from one cohort to another as here described, but passed
through all the posts in one cohort at a time; thus he would be (ι)
posterior hastatus, (a) prior hastatus, (3) posterior pm'neeps, (4) prim
princeps, (5) posterior triarius, (6) prior triarius in the roth cohort, and
so on through the remaining cohorts, till, as before, he reached the
highest post of prior trionis or primipilus of the first cohort. It
should be remarked that each eohort was commanded by its senior
centurion, that is, by its prior triarius (primipilus). In the present
passage hastato appears to be used for manipulo testatorum, and the
meaning is that Fulginius ‘belonged to' (ex) the first maniple of the
hastati, that is, he was the prior hastatus of the first cohort3 on
the other hand T. Caecilius, mentioned directly after, was the primi

pili centurio (=primipilus), that is, the highest of all the centurions
of the legion. The chief authorities on this difficult subject aro· given by

Dr H. Schiller in his Kriegsaltertilmer in Mbller’s hlaudbuch.
