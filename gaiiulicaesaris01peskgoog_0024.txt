conservative ultras, impracticable men such as Cato and others,
wedded to ancient forms and habits of thought, and unable to
accommodate themselves to new views and changing situations.
These men were of course bitter opponents of Caesar. A few
references to Cicero's letters will help to throw light on the keen
political strife which marked the closing years of the Roman
republic. Writing in 59 Cicero inveighs bitterly against the
triumvirate; a short time ago, he says, it was agreeable to the
multitude and harmless, though vexatious, to the Conservatives;
now it is hateful to all alikel. He considers that the old republic
is gone for ever 2. In 56 and 5 ς we find him drawing nearer to the
triumvirs‚ as he recognises the impracticability of the optimates.
Now, he says, I approve of everything that Pompey does, All
freedom of action is gone. We want repose, which our rulers
are likely to give us if certain persons (Cato and others) could
bring themselves to acquiesce more quietly in their supremacy⁸.
ln 54 we find him making approaches to Caesar and to Crassus;
he remarks that all patronage is in the hands ol Caesar* In
the following year it is clear that Pompey’s weakness and
vacillation were fast alienating many of his supporters3 Cicero
calls him ille perennis inimicus amicorum morum& but for all
that he could not bring himself to oppose the triumvirs‚ The
fact is, he says, it is the optimates who have changed, and have
abandoned the mass of law-abiding citizens, from which he
draws the conclusion that all wise citizens should now change
their policy⁰. Signs of the approaching rupture between the two ¹
rivals now began to show themselves, and there were frequent
rumours of an impending dictatorship. Moderate men like
