144 DE BELLO CIVILI. [nra. r.

morantibus] il, as seems probable, the army was following a defined
track across difficult country, the line would extend to some distance,
and the rearguard might naturally be called morantes as compared with
the vanguard. Hence there is no need to alter this to laborantibus.

equites aero] ‘while the cavalry'; this clause, as well as the two
preceding, depends on cum: the word vero, like dariique, added to
the last oi a succession os clauses, denotes the climax.

in auersos] ‘against them when their backs were turned '.

4 relinquebatur, ut] ‘the only course left was that' etc.; cp. 29 ς a,

6352.

cuae...esset] the subjunctive is used ‘of actionS, events, etc. reconuted
not as mere marks ol time, but as essential parts os the historical
narrative, in imperfect and plupersect tenses’ Roby ἓ 1720. The
mood might perhaps be explained by the lact that this clause is
inserted in another subjunctive clause ut...iubereut, and is therefore
what Dr Kennedy called a ‘suboblique' clause, Kenn. L. G. ἐξ 190-193.

incitati cursu] cp. 111. 46 ἓ 5 incitati cursu praecipites Pompeianos
egerunt, 93 ἓ 5 incitati sugas we also find tucetatocursu B. G. 11. 26.

5 tautum...aberant] ‘they were so far from being aided by their

cavalry'; notice that tantum abesse ab is here not used of actual
distance: KH cp. B. G. 1. 36 louge eis fraternum noneeu populi

Romani afuturum.
ultro] the nearest English equivalent to this very expressive word is

‘actually's not only did the cavalry not protect the legions, but the
legions had actually to protect the cavalry.

quin] the use of quin rather than ue shows that licebat is used of
possibility rather than of permission: ‘it was not possible for any one
os them to quit the line of march without being caught by Caesar's
horsemen': tf Caesar had meant ‘no one os them was allowed to quit'
eta, he would have added ne...exciperetur ‘lest he should be caught ³.

Crine. LXXX.

1 pugnatur] this ls a persectly general statement: ‘when a battle is
being fought in this way, troops advance slowly’ etc. lt is shown that
the general statement applies to this particular occasion.

uttam assidit] ‘and so it happened on this occasion': cp. Β. G. vti.
5 nam ubimnrque maior atque illustrior incidit res, clamore per agros
regionesque significant 5 huuc alii der'uceps excipiunt et proximis tradunt,
retum acce'dit.
