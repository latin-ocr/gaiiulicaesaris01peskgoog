genitive noctu added B. G. v11. 26, 36: he does not use the word in
any other t‘orm.

evocatis sagittaria} fhnditoribusque] the light-armed men intended t'or
garrison duty were chosen from three classes of troops, the reinlisted
veterans, the archerS, and the slingers3 but it must be remembered that
the two last named classes were all light-armed3 the evocati, heavy-
armed legionarias, were converted into light-armed men lor this special
service. There may be some fault in the text here.

6 expedito loco] ‘in a saie place': expeditus is the opposite of impeditus

and so ‘free srorn obstruction’, ‘safe'‚ ‘accessible’.

minaria navigia] small swift vessels propelled by oar and sail. “The
word denotes devoted to actm (rerum), i.e. business as opposed to
fighting, not to be explained (as is usual) from remis agere.” J. s. R.

Crine. XXVIII.

t iniuriat] the Pompeian troops probably behaved with great license
in Brundisium ; we know that Cicero and other members os the optimate
party, though siding with Pompey, feared that it victorious he would
repeat the murders and proscriptions of the Sullan regime.

a illis] the Pompeian soldiers

ea rc] the business of departure.

mento] almost like undiquc or passim, ‘everywhere'.

Caesar] it should be remembered that in addition to partially blocking
the harbour Caesar had completely invested the town. Sufficient traces
of his works still exist to show the position of the line ol circumvallation
and the site ot' his three entrenched cumps, one on each side ol the
harbour, over against the two piers, and one on the landward or western
side oi the town.

3 sub noctem] sub with accusative os time may mean ‘just besore’ or
‘just atter' ; cp. Prot. Palmer on Horace Sat. 1. 1. 10 ; here it probably
means ‘just at nightfall'.

quod convenerat] ‘which had been agreed on'; cp. B. G. 1. 36 si
in co manerent quod convenisset, ιι. 19qu0d tempus intereos con·
venerat.

4 vallum caecum] ‘the blind stockade’‚ that is, the hidden tows ol
sudes stipitesque. Notice that caecus may be either ‘not seeing’ or
‘not seen’; so too surdus and κωφός may be ‘not hearing' or ‘not
heard’.

1). 17. scaphis lintribusque] ‘boats and punts' ς it is impossibleto tettae
