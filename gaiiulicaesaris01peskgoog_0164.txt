CHAP. LXVII.

1 consilia] ‘a council of war ¹, cp. 11. 30 S 1 quitus de careus consilia
convocata. A council of this kind usually consisted of the legati, the
tribuni militum and the centuriones.

terpus proscenium} quaeratur] we should say ‘they discuss the proper
time for departure’: lit. ‘they look for', ‘enquire about': cp. 74 ἓ a,
11. 14 ἕ r atlantes sine fide tempus atque occasionem fraudis ae doli
quaerum B. G. vtt. 37 ratio persin'eada' quaeritum v111. 47 consilia
belli quaerentibus.

censebant, ut] Caesar has censere with ut 5 times, aud with gerundial
construction 9 times.

a pridie noctu] ‘the day before at night '‚ i.e. ‘the previous night'r see
below prirua luce postridie ‘early the next morning ’.

quad...essct] ‘the fact that the cry had been raised ’ ; there is no need
for Caesar to specify what the cry was.

3 timori...cansulere] ‘pay regard to their fears rather than the obliga·
tion of their oath': soldiers took an oath of allegiance sacramentum to
their commander. In a civil war, when they were fighting against their
fellow citizens, they would not feel this oath so binding on their
consciences as if they were fighting against enemies of the republic.

4 atacem] I print this difficult sentence as it stands in the uss with
the triding change of ad to at. But the words omnium aculis give uo
satisfactory sense, and Paul’s insertion oi sub before aculis does not help
trs much. Possibly some such words as inieratis rut pugnam have fallen
out before aruncum nutas, the repeated pu of pudorem and pagrtam
having caused the copyist’s eye to stray: cp. B. G. 111. τό amnium oculis
mentibusque ad pugrram intentu. Translate ‘but the daylight of itself
brings with it a considerable sense of honour, when the battle iswaged
before the eyes of all; much too is afforded by the presence of the
military tribunes and the centurions ’-

quibus rebus] loosely referring to the conditions mentioned in the
previous sentence—the public gaze and the presence of the officers.

quibus...saleant] notice that Caesar might well have written milites
(accusative) andoure, this being one of those relative clauses in oratio

obliqua in which some new remark is subjoined about a person or thing
already mentioned, so that qui practically equals et is. Possibly however
he uses quibus rebus in a slightly causal sense. equivalent to cum cis
rebus, and not in the merely connective sense oi et eis rebus. On such
sentences see Reid on Cic. Acad. 1. μς cp. B. G. vit„ gn qaod fatorum
novenae.
