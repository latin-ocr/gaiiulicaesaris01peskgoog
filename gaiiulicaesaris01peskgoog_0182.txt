those constructed by the Massilians (56), and lastly the fleet ol boats
ordered by Afranius to be prepared on the Ebro (61 ἓ 4).

p. 45. summissos] ‘sent to the lront’: verbs of ‘sending’ or ‘going’com·
pounded with sub osten convey the idea of taking or sending assistance,
cp. subvehere, subministrare, subuenire, succurrere, etc.; Roby ξ 2138.

7 Hispanias] the two Spanish provinces, cp. ro ἓ 3.
pacis] there had been no hostilities in Spain since the end os the
Sertorian war in 72 nc.
8 r'n se] ‘against himself ’, ‘with intent to injure him'; seis the accu-
sative.
ut idem...obtineat] this is in part a repetition of the complaint in
11 S r, where see note.
absens] ‘absent from them’ ie. the provinces ; Paul substitutes absentem
sor alienas in 11 ς 1, where however it seems less suitable than here.
Nipperdey refers to Vell. Pat. 11. 4851 easque (Hispanias) per trienninm
absens ipse ac praesidens urbi per Afranium et Petreium cumularem ac
prunonem legatos suos administrabat. It will be remembered that in
the beginning of the year 49 Pompey was in the neighbourhood of Rome
(ad portas) endeavouring to control the course of events in the city,
which, as proconsul and armed with the imperinm, he was unable to
enter.
tat annis] sor the ablative ol duration of time cp. 7 9 6, 465 r, 81 ἓ 33
but no great reliance can be placed on the MSS where only a single letter
isconcerned‚ and perhaps in all these instances the accusative should be

read.

9 comesturam] ‘were being subverted ’.

ne...mittanlur] this repeats the complaint made in 6 ἓ 6. The lex
Pompeia of 52 had enacted that there should be an interval of 5 years
between the tenure of office as consul or praetor and the holding ol a
provincial governorship. The result was that there was now more
uncertainty as to who should hold these appointrnents, and governors
may osten have been appointed by a senatorial clique (per paucos).

aetatis excusationem] ‘plea of age’; the same phrase in B. G. v111.
ra.

quin...evocentur] ‘to prevent men being called out'. The matter
referred tois not clear 3 KH say ‘ Caesar means the proconsules ad urbem
(5 ἓ 3, 6 ἓ 7) who could rightsully claim to be relieved of their imperium
and were now obliged to take commanda, as Cicero sor instance, who,
much against his will, was commissioned to raise troops in Campania
(Cic. Art. vn. ιι 5 5, vnr. 11 D. t 5, vn. η ξ ut'. nne ssssage
