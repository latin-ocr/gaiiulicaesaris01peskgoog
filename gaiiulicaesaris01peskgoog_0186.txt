rensuum. 155

correptis uss, Nipperdey rightly ereptis, cp. 3² ἓ 6 iniuriam in
eripiendis legionibus prmduat. Caesar would not use corripere in
this sense.

4 rebus uss, uerbis adopted by Paul is not necessary, see 8 ξ 4.

³ 1 Pantagathus proposed to insert promptos before Pompeiam: Paul
inserts audaces after laudat, thus making the sentence coutaiu two
words audax and segnis not elsewhere used by Caesar.

3 et ius consutum uss. Hug and Madvig, no doubt rightly, restore
ipsum lor ius. Nipperdey reads militibus for the corrupt etius,
Heller prefers armis. ,

tribunis centurionibus euocatis, so Oudendorp for tr. pl. centurio
evocat.

4 3 arbitratur h l a f 3 arbitrabatur b, Dinter, Diibner.

adulatio atque ostentatio sui et potentium uss; Madvig omitting
adulatio writes atque ostentatio sui et polentiae, qua...pollebat,· Reid
suggests potentia comm for potentium.

ὅ ι intercessione uss: some editors omit the word: KH and Ε. Holi-
munn retain it. The former take extremum ius to deuote the tri·
bunicial inviolability‚ and suppose Caesar’s meaning to be that the
tribunes were not now allowed to preserie their inviolability by the
exercise of their intercessio, a privilege which (quod for id quod) Sulla
had left them. Dr Reid proposes legitimi for extremi. Helles
intercessionis.

aocto denique meuses varelrrum actionum nrss3 Dinter inserts post
which might easily have been absorbed by plebes. E. Hoffmann
ultimo denique mense securum actionum Aldus, Nipperdey, Paul
octavo denique mense setarum actionum (octauo is found in f); KH
after Mommsen toto denique emenso spatio suamne actionum. Ciacco-
nius and Diibner have duodecimo. No correction cau be regarded
us more than barely probable.

gsalutis lotorum andacia nunqnam arete discessum cst uss. Kohl's
cj. descensum for discessum may be considered certain. For latorum
Manutius aud Madvig suggest latronum, perhaps too strong a word
for the circumstances, as Nipperdey says. Paul, partly following
Kindscher‚ reads soluta sceleratomm audacia, Reid legis Momm
animoa retaining salutes, so too Ε. Hoffmann, who however makes
further needless alterations; Hug and others senatorum.

cons. or mmules uss; Pantagathus pro consulibus ,¹ Ο hl have sunt,

but sint is required.

5 leuissimis uss3 bur lenissimis is necessary.
