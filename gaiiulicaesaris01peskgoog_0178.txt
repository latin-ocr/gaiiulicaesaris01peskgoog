os the world (‘in the eyes ol all') would prove highly detrimental'
(lit. ‘brought with it great detriment ’).

opinionem] it is difficnlt to fix the precise meaning of this word: it
means sometimes ‘opinion ’‚ ‘thought’, ‘feeling ’‚ sometimes ‘expecta-
tion ’‚ sometimes ‘estimation’, ‘reputation’. KH take it here in the
last named sense ‘the good opinion which the soldiers had of Caesar ’,
in which case there would be little difference between it andjam, since
fama emnium seems to mean the repnte in which all held Caesar. The
two words are thus united in 111. 36 ἓ 1 nuntiatum est adesseSnpionem
enagna opimone et fama omnium, 56 ἓ n Pompeius autern nt famam
opinionumque hominnm teneret.

3 endem causis] ‘by the same reasons’, to be taken with movebatur. 1

which Caesar says his readers are acquainted (qnae sunt cognitae), are
those given in 72, vin, the desire to avoid nnnecessary bloodshed etc.;
