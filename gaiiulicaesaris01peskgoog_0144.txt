CAPP.XL111.—XLV.] NOTES.

Cura. XLIV.

1 ut] the clause with ut is explanatory oi the noun in the main clause
(genus) ε cp. 11. 18 ἓ 6 ratio autem haec erat belli ut se...conferret (qu. by

KH); Cic. Verr. 11. 129 est carssreetuda Siculumns‚..ut nonuunquam...
eximant: Draeger HS. 11. ἓ 405.
rari dispersique] ‘singly and in scattered order ’.
p. 25. a assuefacti] with ablativo ‘habituated in’; cp. B. G. lv. r nulla

offida aut disciplina assuefacti, 3 Gallicis suut moribus assuefacti.

3 quod] probably the relative, not ‘because’a ‘a thing which usually
happeus'; this is further explained by the ut clause which follows.

4 insuetas leuius generis pugnae] sor the genitive with insuetus cp. 111.
49 5 33 B. G. v. 6, vit. 30: it can also take an ablative as in Livy
xxviii. reimarus maribus Romanis. Notice that pugnae may be the
genitive alter generis or vice versa; you can say leae genus pugreae or
pugna husus generis without any appreciable difference in the meaning;
cp· essu·

ab aperto latere] ‘on their exposed flank‘‚ ie. on their lein they
were afraid oi the Xthh legion being outflanked: sometimes the
preposition is omitted in this phrase, in which case it is a local ablative,
cp. B. G. 1. 25, 11. ²3·

apsi...apertere] the text is probably faulty. KH say ‘oportet can take
a simple infinitivo when the subject is indefinite, but requires an
accusative and infinitiva when the subiect is definite: with discedere
and servare the subject is indefinite, “one rnnst” etc.; with diutim the
implied subject is definite' i.e. ‘they did not think it right that they
should relinquish' etc. This explanation may be adopted as a
temporary expedient.

5 in ea cornu] the left wing which was occupied by the XIVth.

proximum collem] apparently some rising ground at the back of their
position and westward of Puig Bordel. Stoffel calls it Las Collades.

Crine. XLV.
