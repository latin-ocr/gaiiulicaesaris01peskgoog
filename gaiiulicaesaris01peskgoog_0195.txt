1⁶4 aa aaran carras.

gurarari atque iter impedire nss; Paul, comparing B. G. vn. 40 iter
earum moratur atque impedit, reads impedire iter. The suggestion is
probable, but there would beno great difficulty in mentally supplying
eos with neerari. If any change is needed I should prefer to transpose
atque and iter.

0⁴ 1 interrumpi nss; Nipperdey irrumpi, Forchhammer iter interrumpi.

ascrri iuss ; the editors agree in reading inferri.

4 tantae magnitudini fluminis af, tantae niagnitudinis fluminis Ο h l
(with flunrini as a correction in O): cp. magnitudo fluminis 50 ἓ ι,
aquae magnitudo 40 § 3, 50 ἓ a. The reading of Ο tantae magni-
tudinis flumini ‘to a river of such size’ would be equally good.

7 arma in flumine nss3 Nipperdey abrepti vi fluminis, Diibner ablati
flumine. It is difficult to account satisfactorily for the corruption in
the uss

Saddito ad undum circuitu all iuss except c, which places ad uadum
before fluminis, and so all recent editors. Forchharnmer and Diibner
regard the words as a marginal gloss.

00 4namtes intra sc recipiebant mss, Nipperdey rightly montes intrare
cupiebant: apparently intrare was confused with intrare, then the
syllable re, added asa correction, becanm attached to cupiebant.
Aldus read intra ntordes se recipiebant.

00 radaquandi causa uss3 this may be due to a confusion between
aquandi causa and ad aquandum.

0⁷ aad lucem multum perse Mss; most editors retain this with the

substitution oi at for ad. The whole sentence is strangely worded,
and there may be sorne deep-seated corruption. See my note.

F. Kindscher and E. S. Thompson suggest praesentia, in which case
tribunorum...praesentia would balance arterium aculis.
6 evincit all uss, but vincit occurs as a correction in Ο.
88 1 exercitum educit Mss; Aldus restored ducit: the mistake arose from
the preceding edunt.
a inermes f, inermis a b, inermih l; there is little or no authority for
the form inermus in Caesar.
00 1 nec necessarii la f, nar nec necessarii h; read perhaps with Morus
nostras necessarii. E. S. Thompson ej. nastris necesse rati...caactis.
acensilium surim laudibus ferebant uss; Pluygers and Paul read
efferebant comparing 111. 875 r Pompei consilium summis laudibus
efferret: in the present passage it is possible that we should read
suum summis.
ad iter nss3 proficisci ad iter is an unusual if not unexampled
