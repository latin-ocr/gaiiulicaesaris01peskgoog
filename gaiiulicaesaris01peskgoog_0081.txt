50 DE BELLO CI VILI. [ura 1.

paucis fere] ‘only a few’: Cicero would have written medo.

5 correpte] ‘caught up': tr. ‘all these were caught up and assailed
with vehement invective by the consul L. Lentulus ’‚ cp. Hor. Sat. 11.
3. 257 correptus uoce magistri. The consul’s violent language is attested
by Plutarch Caes. 30, Λέντλου τοῦ ὑπάτου βοῶντος ὅπλων δεῖν πρὸς ἄνδρα
λῃστὴν ori ψήφων, though he assigns it to a different part of the day's
proceedings: his account is altogether confusing, cp. Pomp. 58 Μαρ-
κέλλου τοῦ ὑπάτου ληστὴν ἀποκαλοῦντος τὸν Καίσαρα.

pronuntiaturum] the presiding magistrate is said pronuntiare ‘to
put’ a motion to the senate to be voted ou.

Marcellus] the M. Marcellus οἰδ r.

conviciis] cp. 23 ἓ 3 insomnes productos a contumeliis militum con-
viciisque prohe'brt ,¹ above ἓ 5 convicio L. Lentuli. The plural is more
appropriate where the abuse proceeds from various quarters3 so here the
reference is to the Pompeian senators generally.

6 vocibus] ‘expressions ¹, ‘language '‚ see below 35 5 quornm vocibus er
concursu. The plural is always used of a startling or otherwise re·
markable utterance.

iuviti et coacte] these words are not coordinate with compulsi, but
form a kind of abverbial adjunct to it: ‘a large number impelled (corn
pulsi) by...against their will and yielding to pressure adopt the opinion
of Scipio ’. According to Dion XLI. r only tw0, Curio and Rufus,
voted against Scipio's proposal. [Plut. Ant. 5 says that many senators
were influenced by the terms of Caesar's letter which they thought just
and moderate δίκαια rol μέτρια. J. s. n]

ante certam diem] from the expression erepto semestri imperio in 9
5 r we may assume with Lange R. A. 111. 406 and Mommsen Rechts-
frage p. 58 that the date in questionwas July rst‚ which would just
allow os Caesar’s offering himself in person as a candidate for the con·
sulship the requisite time (trinum nundinum) before the electiori.
Others take the date to be March ret.

8 intercedit] M. Antonius is chiefly in the writer's thought, hence he
begins the sentence with the singular intercedit though two nouus
follow and the plural tribuni in apposition to them: asimilar sentence
is ‘and so was also james, and John, the sons of Zebedee'. Lulre
V. 10.

refertur] Scipio's proposal, though carried by an overwhelming
majority, could not be embodied in a senatus ceres-ultum on account of
the veto of the tribunes: their intervention provoked a fresh debete.
The resolution was however placed on record as an auctoritas ἡγνώμη
