92 DE BELLO CI VILI. [tra. 1.

prium Brundisio ad. XVI K. Apriles (17 March) curu crinibus cupiit
quar tabuit profectum esse ; Caesarem postero die in ‹ppidum introisse.
Rumours os Pompey’s departure at an earlier date had reached Cicero,
Att.1x. 1351, 145 3.

3 sub] ‘justat the moment oi'3 cp. B. G. v111. ¹49 sub decessu siro.
“This temporal use of sub with ablative not before Caesar, though
Cicero has the corresponding local use (Att. xrv. y ἓ ι sub Lanuuio
‘close to') which Draeger says is only poetical.” J. s. R.

oppidum] the ress omit in as in 11. 13 ᾖ 4 quin oppidum irrum-
perent where however iu might easily have fallen out atter quin. Paul
inserts the preposition, but leaves 111. 111 ἓ 1 primo impetu domum eius
irrumpere conatur, though Cic. de orat. 111. 168 has in domum irruen-
pere: as a mle the simple accusative is poetical and in late prose.

urias plateasque] ‘streete and squares': vicus (οἶκος) is properly a
group or row of homes, then the street formed by them; platea (πλατεῖα)
is a broad open space.

inaedificat] ‘builds up ³, ie. ‘blocks'; cp. Livy xurv. 45 nec
clausae mado partae sedetiam reaedificatae erant; Cic. Har. Resp. 32
a Sex. Serrano sanctissima sacella sufflssa inaedificata oppressa...
nescimus?

uiis] the exact construction oi this word is not certain, but it is
probably governed by praeducit, ‘draws trenches at right angles in sront
of the streets'3 cp. Silius Ital. x. 410 fhssas instant praeducere rreun's.
For transversus ‘across’, ‘at right angles’ cp. B. G. 11. 8 transuersam
fassam obduxit. Dr Reid suggests transuersis viis like transverse
itinere, flumine etc.

ibe]=ira eis, ep. 26§ r.

sardes stipitesque] ‘stakes and blocks of wood'.

4 haec...inaequat] ‘he levels these (with the rest of the road) by
cavering them with light hurdles and earth’. The word inaequat is
ἅπαξ εἰρημένου elsewhere Caesar has aequare or adaequare, and
Dr Reid thinks that the ire here may be a temnant of some word such
as iniectu.

aditus] ‘approaehes'3 the duo belongs only to itinera: cp. Β. G.
vt. 9 aditus viasque iu Suebos perquirit. By duo itinera are probably
meant the narrow strips os shore between the walls of the town and the
twoarmsof the sea.

trabibus] ‘balks of timber’: these were fixed deeply in (defluat) with
their sbarpeued ends projecting.

· saturetur) an adverbial ablative very frequent in Caesar, twice with
