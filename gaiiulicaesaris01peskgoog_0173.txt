a magno in horrore] cp. 111. 47 ἓ 7 pecus...mugno in horrore habebam
sometimes the in is omitted, cp. Β. G. v. 54 quos praecipuo semper
donare Caesar haberit.

priores orditus] ‘their former posts' or ‘centurias’, ordo being often
equivalent to centuria.

equites...ion0rem] beware of confusing the equites Romani with the
ordinary cavalry serving in the Roman armies3 the latter at this period
was not composed of Roman citizens at all, but was drawn from the
allies. The equites here mentioned are Roman knights, who occasionally
joined the army and served as tribuni militum and praefecti ,· hence·
Caesar says that he restored these knights ad tribunicium honorem, ie.
to the posts of tribuni militum which they had previously held in
Pompey's army. So too in B. G. ιιι 7 the prefects and military
tribunes spoken of were evidently mounted officers, and see Caesar’s
joke in B. G. 1. 4²² cp. Madvig, Kleine Philologische Schriften, p. 501

difficulties in their foraging'; for the construction cp. B. G. v. 28 re

copebm...non nullam] ‘a certain quantity’, thar is, a fairly large
amount; so non nulli dominer means ‘several men’, not ‘scarcely
any men’. Hence Stoffel is wrong in sayiug ‘ils n’en avaient plus
qu’une petite quantite'.

XXII] 1 agree with the majority of commentators in thinking this
number far too large; the Afranians had only left Ilerda 4 or 5 days
before, and if they had had provisions for 17 days remaining, there
would have been plenty to spare for the cetrati and auxiliares. Bur ,
instead of altering it to VIII with Gdler or VII with Dinter, I
should prefer XII as accounting better for the corruption. We know
from Cic. Tusc. 11. 37 that Roman soldiers often carried plur quam
