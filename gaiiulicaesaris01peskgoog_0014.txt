PREFACE.

N preparing this book I have made constant use ol
the editions of Nipperdey (1847), Kraner revised hy
F. Hosmann¹, ed. 9 (1885), Moberley (1888), Dinter (1888),

Paul (1889), Ε. Hoffmann (1890). But no existing edition
can rank in importance with the great work of M. le Colonel
Stoffel entitled ‘Histoire de Jules Cesar, Guerre Civile‚’
which continues the late Emperor Napoleon's work on the
Gallie War. This book with its fine atlas has been ot the
greatest use to me. Another book of great value, though in
a different way, is the ‘Lexicon Caesarianum' os H. Meusel,
not yet completed, probably the most elaborate and com·
prehensive dictionary of a single author ever published.
Merguet’s ‘Lexicon zu den Schriften essars und seiner
Fortsetzer,' compiled on a simpler plan, is also extremely
uselul, and has the merit of taking into account the three
treatises usually included in editions of Caesar². Among
other books that Ι have had occasion to consult I may
mention in particular, General August von Goler's Der
Biirgerkrieg zwischen Casar und Pompeius, R. Schneider's
Die Schlacht bei Ilerda, H. Nissen’s Der Aushruch des
Burgerkriegs, which appeared in Von Sybel’s Historische
Zeitschrift xciv (1880) and xnvr (1881), Mommsen’s Die
Rechtssrage zwischen Casar und dem Senate‚ Langc's Rom-
ische Alterthiimer, H. F. Pelham’s article ‘Rome' in the
Encyclopaedia Britannica To these Ι may now add Prof.
Tyrrell's interesting sketch os the political history of this
period in the Introduction to the third volume of his edition
