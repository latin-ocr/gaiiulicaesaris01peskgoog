and to stimulate them by the promise of large rewards.
qui petant atque orent] ‘to convey urgent entreaties’; the second
verb supplements and intensifies the first, cp. B. C. VI. 9 petunt atque
orant ut sibi porcat: so too orare atque obsecrare often occurs.
locorum angustias] the plain of Corfinium was almost encircled by
mountains, and there were apparently only three approaches to it,

ten', ‘platz'‚ Doberenz)‚ but in its derived sense of an allotted portion
or share of duty, cp. 111. 51 ὃ 4 attae enim sum legati partes atque
imperatoris ; so too Meusel Lex. s. v. takes it.
4 contione] this term is frequently applied to an harangue delivered by
an officer to his men.
ax mis possessionibus] ‘this enormous offer of lands gives an idea of
the immense possessions of a Roman noble, and the reasons which made

grants from Sulla out of his wholesale confiscations’ (Moberleylz cp.
