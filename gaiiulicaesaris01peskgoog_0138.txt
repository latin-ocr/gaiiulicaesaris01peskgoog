genitives citerioris procinctae, ulterioris Hispaniae, rolriusquo provinciae.
The objection to the word Hispaniae of course is that Caesar would not
be likely to insert it directly aiter provinciae which could so easily be
supplied again with the adjective ulterioris.

LXXX] M. storel, judg'mg from the disposition of the Pompeian
forces ln 83 5 ι, thinks this number too large, and proposes to read
XXX.

r auxilia peditum V ardea] the text here is in a hopelessly disordered
state: the reading here given is the one generally adopted and is to a
certain extent supported by Cicero Att.1x. 13 §4 nam ego hunc ita
paratum araca peditatu, equitatu, classibus, auxiliis Gallorum, quos
Matius ἐλάπιζεν, ut puto, sed certe dicebat podz'tum decem milia, equitum
sex polliceri sumptu sua annos decom It will be seen that 'Cicero here
gives the exact double of the equitum III milia mentioned by Caesar,
and so agrees with Caesar’s statement that he doubled his cavalry force
by raising 3000 horsemen in Gaul (parem ox Gallia numerum); and on
thesame ground it is inserted that is the very doubtful reading podium
docem milia in Cicero be assumed correct we should be justified in
reading podium V milia in Caesar.

quae] this is only found in one late MS, but improves the sense.
Caesar had 3000 cavalry during his previous campaigns, and he now
levies another 3000 from Gaul. Itis probable that the words parem cx
Gallia numeram also refer back to the (supposed) peditum V milia, so
that we are to understand Caesar as meaning that he doubled the
infantry as well os the cavalry of his auxiliary force. The student will
notice how much supposition is required to make any tolerable sense out
of a large portion os this chapter.

pasavera] Caesar had crushed Gaul into submissior by a war of nine
years duration; thisbe calls ‘pacification’.

lruc] the text is again defective: for lruc the uss have tino and
after attingunt some words are lost 3 adiecerat is a conjectural insertion:
one of the genitivos optimi germis or hominum seems to depend on
some number that has been lost3 this number may lie concealed in the
word ltinc, or perhaps millo (written m) has fallen out aster the m
