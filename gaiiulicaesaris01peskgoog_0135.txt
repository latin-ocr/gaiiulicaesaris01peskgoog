104 DE BELLO CI VILI. [nra. r.

C. Trebonium] originally a supportet of the aristocratia party he
early espoused the cause of Caesar, and in his tribunam, 55, he proposed
the lex Trebonia by which Caesar‘s tenure of the provincial governor-
ships of the two Gauls and Illyricum was prolonged for another five
years. He was made one of Caesar's legati and is often mentioned in
the Gallie War. He was afterwards one of the conspirators, and was
finally murdered by Dolabella in 43.

chio. XXXVII.

r C. Fabium] see note on 18 ἓ 5. When we last hear of Fabius,
B. G. Vnt. 54, he was stationed in winter quarters among the Aedui.
Probably the same despatch which ordered him to send a legion to
Caesar in Italy also directed him to shift his headquarters to Narbo.
The date on which he left Narbo cannot be determinem but is con·
Jectured to have been about 10 May. He would take from ro to
ra days to reach Ilerda, a distance of about ²²4 miles.

saltus Pyrenaeos] ‘the passes of the Pyrenees' ε the ordinary route
from Narbonese Gaul to Spain probably lay from Narbo through
Ruscino (Perpignan) and by the foot of the Puy Camellas through la
Junquera‚ and southwards to Barcino (Barcelona) and Tarraco (Tarra-
gona). There was another pass to the west of this by the valley of the
Tet, see below, 5 3.

L. Afranio] consul in 60 when he must according to the law have
been at least 43 years of age, which would make him not less than
54 at this date. When Pompey in 55 received the control of the
Spanish provinces for 5 years he entrusted their administration to
Afranius and Petreius; cp. Vell. Pat. 11. 48. 1.

a reliquos legiones] this no doubt refers to the three veterarr legions
which had been under Caesar's command in Italy, the VIIIth, XlIth,
and XlIlth. Caesar would thus have 6 veteran legions for the war
in Spain; cp. 39 ἕ a Caesar legiones in Hz'spaniam proeorz'serat sex.
Stoffel 1. 259.

3 ex saltu deiecit] Stoffel and Goler agree that the pass here men-
tioned is that crossed hythe road which, branching off from Perpignan
to the right, follows the valley of the Tet up to Puigcerda and then
descends on the other side by the valley of the Segre or Sicoris to
Urgel. But R. Schneider, Ilerda, pp. 1-3, maintains that Fabius took
the route above mentioned by Junquera and Gerona.
