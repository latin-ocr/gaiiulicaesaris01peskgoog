several ditches increasrng in depth from 3 to 6 ft. A chanuel was then
made to carry off the overfiow from the basin into a small tributary of
the N oguera Rivagorzana. He calculates that by this means 3456000
cubic feet of water would be drawn off in an hour, which would have
the effect of reducing the main stream in a few hours by about afeet
and so rendering it fordable. His calculations, based on those of
Guischard and of Baron d'Arletan, who prepared them for Frederick the
Great, are interesting and curious.

u perveniunt] the nearest parallel to this use of peruenire in Caesar is
B. G. v. 45 res ad paucitatem defensorum perueruerat, vll. 6. Generally
it is used of a literal arrival.

ocultum...valelrat] au adverbial accusative, cp. μέγα δύνασθαι ‘to
have power in agreat degree ’, ‘to be very powerful'r note that
ncognnm valere is not good latin.

loeis excedere] ‘to quit the district ¹ ς there is uo need to add eis.

Celtiberiam] cp. 38 § 3.

3 suffragabatur] ‘favoured ', a sense derived from the literal meaning ‘to
vote for '. The word is frequent in Cicero, but does not occur elsewhere
in Caesar.

generibus] ‘classes ¹, that is, of states.

superiore bello] 80-72 1³.c.; cp. 2913* 3.

iric] in Celtiberia, where they were intending to go.

suis loa’s] ‘in a place of their own choosing' : sum in this sense of
‘favourable to oueself ¹ is not uncommou; cp. Horace Epod. xi. 30
ventac aiurus nonanis. Kortte qu. by Stoffel 11. 347 says sua loco
sunt sibi opportuno et quoe vel optaverat, oei etegent sibi adpugnam.

bellum in nomem ducere] Stoffel has a long excursus, 11. 365-384‚
ou bellum trahere and bellum ducere, arguing that the former means
simply ‘to prolong the war’, while bellum ducere farther implies putting
off the decisive battle, or carrying on a defensive warfare.

4 conquirere] the subject oi conquirere is indefinite and not expressed,
‘order propte to search’; then with the second verb adduci the subject
is changed, ‘order them (the ships) to be brought’: but perhaps conquiri
should be read. There is a somewhat similar change in B. G. vn.
73 erat eodem tempore et materiari et frumentari (deponentsl et tantae
munitionesfieri (passive) necesse.

Octogesom] the place is mentioned nowhere else and its exact site is
much disputed. Schneider places it at Flix ou the right bank oi the
