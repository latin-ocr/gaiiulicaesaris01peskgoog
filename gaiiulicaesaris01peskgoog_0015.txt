of Cicero’s Letters. To Dr J. S. Reid Ι am much indebted
for his kindness in reading through a portion of my notes
and sending me many useful additions and corrections Ι
only regret that owing to pressure of time I was not able to
submit to him the notes on more than 40 chapters.

I may mention that in the division of the chapters into
sections I have followed the arrangement of Nipperdey ¹,
which is also adopted by Paul and by Meusel in his Lexicon.
The fact that Meusel has adopted it in a work the utility of
which depends so much on facility of reference should make
it incumbent on all future editors to follow the same
distribution, even though it may not be in all respects as
satisfactory as one could wish.

Four maps or plans accompany this edition. Two of
them, the plan of Brundisium and the map of the Segre, are
outlined, without details, from those given in Stoffel’s Atlas.

I have added an Introduction, the object of which is
merely to give a brief sketch of the events that led up to
the Civil War. In an appendix will be found a list of the
more important variations of the MSS, andos some of the
alterations of the text that have been proposed.

ΙΝ this edition I have corrected a few mistakes and
1 slightly modified some of the notes. In doing this Ι have
been helped by notices of my book in the Classical Review
of July 1891 and in the Athenaeum of Aug. 8, 1891, and by
some useful notes which Ι owe to the kindness of Mr E. S.
Thompson of Christ's College. Ι regret that the limits
imposed on this revision have prevented me from making
as much use of these and other materials as they deserve.
