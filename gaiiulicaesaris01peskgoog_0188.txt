Aaronom. 157

a l l have cons. and h cons. non. The reading that I have suggested
(see note) si punctis consularibus comitc'i's non preosectus essct, il written
compendiously (cons. com), might account ior the various corruptions
and would give the required sense.

4dnabus legionibus MSS, but legionibus is obviously wrong. It was
first omitted by Daris. Supply cohortibus from the previous clause.

14 rod pecuniam MSS, perhaps et ad pecuniam, the et haring been
absorberi by ocnhset. Paul aiter hlwrites aci pecuniamque, cp.
B. G. Π. rr snb occasumque, vn. r de senatusque conscilio.

4 moductos dh li, dedentes a b, Nipperdey.

spe supplied by Nipperdey.

5 sanctiores MSS, all recent editors samiliass the mistahe was
originally due to an idea on the part oi a copyist that cassarentur was
acc. pl.

1⁵ 3 magnoparte MSS; Scaliger first inserted a.

10 r Firmo Mss; this is needlessly altered by nrost editors to Asculo, see
note.

18 n legionis VIII MSS, but the number is clearly wrong, cp. below ἓ 5.
Voss substituted XIII.

6circumoenire MSS, but the word is scarcely defensible though re·
tained by most editors I read circummunire with Paul: see note.

a Pompeia a and most editors: ac Pompeium Oihl and Paul.

19 ,obsidione atque appuli circummunitione MSS. Meusel would place
oppidi after circummunitione, Paul after obsidione. I do not think any
change isnecessary. ' ’

20 r primo vesperi hia: primo vespere i.

5eius potestate aibd; in dees potestatem Ohls cp. B. G. 11. 3¹ §.3 se
suaque omnio eornm potestati permittere with B. G. 11. 3 ἐ a se suoque
menia insident atque in potestatem populi Ronmni pemittere.

21 3iis merlus all MSs except e which has in,· the preposition seems
necessary and is adopted by Paul. Nipperdey, KH, Dinters cp. B. G.
vr1.8r quas in opere disposuerant.

4 adservent af; observent hl 3 either verb would do.

5 eo MSS. the probable correction vero is due to Faernus,

22 3de solute sno orat nssz ogit was inserted aster sna by Bentley and
is adopted by most editors: but Ε. Hoffmann retains the Ms reading
with erecu (found in l) in place of eo. and ueterem qnoque ior veterem
qne.

5 in eo re MSS: the words are very likely corrupt3 Faernus conjectured
ininn'u which Paul adopts.
