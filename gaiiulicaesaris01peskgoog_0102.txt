these titles of the centurions were the only relies oi the old military
organisation that were lest at the end of the Republic.

qui...duxerat] Caesar expresses himself rather obscurely. The
meaning seems to be that'Pupius was an old officer oi Pompey's eastem
army settled in Picenum, who had been allowed his old rank in the new

hastily raised levies. These levies are not regarded as properly au
aramius Pompei ; they are only milites Ariani, a somewhat contemp-

tuous title.
Cusr. XIV.

r quibus...uuutiatis] the sequence oi events, not clearly marked here
by Caesar, was as follows. On the news oi Caesar's advance, which

reached Rome by the 17th, such panic ensued that Pompey and the Α

leading members of his party fled in confusion from the city, neglecting
to secure the money deposited in the treasury3 cp. cic. Att. vlt. 15 ἕ 3
(written 26 Jan.) sumus enimstagitiose imparati cum a militibus tum a
pecunia quam quidem omnem nau moda priuatam, quae iu urbe est, sed
etiam publicam, quaein aerario est, illi (ior Caesar) reliquimus: on 8

Cassius tribunus pl. venit, attuls‘i mandata ad consules, ui Rumam
uenirent, pecuniam de sanctiore aerario auferrent, statim exirent. It
appears from Caesar that Lentulus went back for this purpose, opened
the treasury, and lorthwith ssed, apparently without taking any money,
terrified by the report that Caesar was close at hand ; ep. Cic. Att. vul.
