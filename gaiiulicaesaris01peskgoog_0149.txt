118 oe nereo estne [nn. 1.

proluit] ‘washes down’, in the form of water: cp. Lucan 1v. 83
iamque Pyrenaeae quas nunquam solvere Titan Ι evaluit fluxere nives,
fractoque madescunt Ι saxa gelu· Τὴε whole ol Lucan’s rather turgid
description of this storm and flood should be read.

3 ut supro] Caesar had not expressly stated before that his camp
was between two rivers, but a glauce at the map will show that it
was so.

Cingam] the Cinga (now Cinea) joins the Segre on the right about
5or 6 miles from the junction ol the latter with the Ebr0‚ or perhaps
it would be more correct to say, following Lucan 1v. 21 loll, that the
Segre joins the Cinea. Between them lies lor the most part a level
plain, Lucan lv. 19 explieat hinc tellus cantpos effusa patentes Ι vix oculo
prendente modum. To this plain Caesar was now confined‚ as each
river was too swollen for 30 miles os its course to admit of being
crossed. There are said to be traces ol a brook which in such westher
might easily become a torrent, running through Caesur’s lines, cp. Lucan
tv. 87 iam naufraga campo! Caesaris arma natant impulsaque gurgite
multo Ι costra labant ,· to this wateroourse Lucan may refer in the words
medius dirimit tentoria gurges ιν. 18, where tentoria may be Caesar's
tents.

4 veniebant] ‘were on their way’.

5 frumento] the standing crops, to be distinguished from frumentum:

cp. B. G. vt. 29 cum maturescere frumenta inciperent, and elsewhere.
' hibernes] at first sight this does not seem to suit frumento (‘standing
erops’)‚ but the plural frumenta may be conditioned by the following
clause neque multum a maturitate oberant. I therefore hesitate to
accept herbis the ingenious conjecture ol Hellebodius: cp. M. Cato in
A. Gellius xm. 18 nunc ita aiunt, in segetibus, in herbis bona frumenta
esse (qu. by Davies): ‘on the one hand, the corn was notin the
green blade, so as to be good for forage3 and, on the other, it was not
ripe enough to supply food for men’. (Moberley.)

exinanitae] ‘impoverished’.

relique] partitive genitive aster quid, practically the same as si quid
relictumsuerat.

7 leves armaturae] a genitive os description after Lusitani ,· cp. 83 ἓ 5
Germanos levis armaturae.

cetrati] see note on 395 1.

proclive] properly ‘sloping’, ‘downhill’‚ hence ‘easy’, ‘naturave in
this derived sense we use the word ‘proclivity’.

qued] this qued, as in 44 § 3. shows how easily and imperceptibly
