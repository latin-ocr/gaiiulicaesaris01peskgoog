5 humanitate Mss ; hnmilitate restored by Aldus.
6neque tat tantasque classes paratas Mss3 the editors generally regard
this passage as corrupt, hut see note. Nipperdey proposes neque tat
tantaque auxilia parata, Paul reads neque equitatus peditatusque tauta
auxilia parata, too wide a departure from the Mss
8 praesidia MSs: Aldus restored praesideat.
tat annas O h l, tat annisa t; either would be correct, cp. B. C.
111. 59 ξ 1 qui principatum in ciuitate multis annis (all MSS)
obtinuerat, B. G. 1. 3 regnum in Sequanis multas anuos obtinuerat.

3flagitaretur MSS, Dinter; Aldus and other editors flagitarmtur.
postulatum est MSS, except a which omits est, and ‘two interior
Mss’ which have postulant. Dinter reads postularunt, which is
necessary to the sense if flagitaretur he read; with flagitarentnr we
may retain postulatum est.
