1 ellonem locnm] the authorities are agreed that the spot in question
is to be sought at a distance of from ato 4 kilometres above Ilerda3
cp. 64 ἓ 8 where the circuit by the sord from Caesar’s camp to the river
bank opposite Ilerda is reckoned at 6 miles (5] English miles). The
bed ol the river here broadens out, and the stream flows lor the most
part iu one main and two or more subsidiary channels, leaving here and
there stretches of exposed river bed. As to the method however by which
the derivation os the stream was effected, the authorities differ seriously.
Gbler and Stofiel suppose that Caesar’s ditches were dog from the main
body of the stream, os equal depth with it, and were carried parallel to
the river for some little distance, and then emptied into it again. These
ditches, being only 30 st. wide, could easily be crossed by planks, and
the main stream, being thus diminished in volume, would be easily
sordable. But Schneider, following Guischard, argues that a stream
like the Segre flowing at the rate oi a feet a second would not be
appreciably lowered by such derivation of its waters, and that Caesar’s
work must have been ol a more elaborate character. He supposes that
on the right bank, where the level oi the adjacent country is below the
river bank, Caesar had a large basin dug about 6 st. in depth, into
which he diverteda considerable part (partem aliquam) of the river by
