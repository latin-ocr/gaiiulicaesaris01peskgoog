114 DE BELLO CI VILI. [mn. 1.

lacum r'rar'quum] the hill on which Ilerda is built is precipitous and
difficult oi access except on the S.W. side, where there is a slope
leading up from the plain to the top oi the plateau and partly enclosed
by two projecting spurs oi rock, one os which, that on the S.E. side of
the slope, forms a long narrow and steep ledge. The men ol the IXth
incautiously pursuing the retreating Pompeians up this slope found
themselves, when the latter turned to bay under the walls os the town,
in an extremely critical situation. They were hemmed in on the
narrow slope by the two flanking spurs of rock and exposed to a shower
os missiles from the enemy who were on higher ground and had the
walls ol the town at their back. To retreat down the slope would ot
course be satal. Nothing was lest for them to do but to hold their
position as wellas they could.
4 praeruptus] ‘the place was precipitous with a steep wall oi rock on
either side’. This describes the two walls oi rock running downwards
from the town and skirting the slope on either side. For the juxtaposition

oi the words praeruptus and derectus cp. 11. 24 ἓ 3 id autem est iugum
derectum, eminens in mare, utraque ex parte praeruptum atque asperum.

latitudinem] the extreme width of the slope near the lower end
measured between the lateral escarpments os the two spurs of rock is
stated by M. Stoffel to be about 340 yardsz nulli telum vibrare vacabat
says Lucan 1v. 40.

ut...explerent] ‘as just to give room for three cohorts drawn up in
battle array’: notice that eum would have been sufficient without the
addition of lacum.

5 tmuisastrgia] ‘by a slight descent': 1 see no objection to the word
tenuis thus used, though Hotoman and Paul read leni comparing 11. 24
5 3 paula leniore fastigia...ad Uticam verget.

passus circiter CCCC] Stoliel estimares the length oi the rise at 600
yards or about 400 paces

6 incitati studia] above ἐ a elati stridit.

nitebantur] ‘struggled', ‘'strove‘: virtute and patientia are madal
ablatives, ‘with courage and endurance’ : it would not make such good
sense to take them as ablatives aiter nitebantur meaning ‘they relied on
their courage and endurance‘, though this would be grammatically
possible, cp. B. G. vm. ιο tamen Germanarum adventu barbari ni'te·
tantur ‘relied on the arrival': with the present passage cp. B. G. lv.
24 nan eadem alacritate ac studia...nilebantur (al. utebantur).

7 illes] the Pompeians.
per apsidum] apparently the reiniorcemcuts sent by Atranius from
