82 DE BELLO CI VJLI. [Lm. 1.

Cnar. XXI.

1 magno] a genitive of velue, perhaps originally a locative; see also

note on interesse 24 ἓ 5.

oppido potiri] the ablativa is usual with potiri in Caesar, with the
doubtful exception of B. G. 1. 3, where the genitive is found, and
of 11. 7 potiundi oppidi, 111. 6 potiundorum oppidorum, where the form
of the phrase implies an accusative.

quo] nominative agreeing with commutatio.

mammetis] this metaphor from the dipping of a scale is frequent,
cp. 111. 68 5 1 sed fortuna quae plurimum potest cum in reliquis
rebus tum praecipue in bella, parvis momentis magnas rerum commuta·
teonescfficit.

intercederent] the idea conveyed by the vvord is that of an event
‘interposing' itself in the ordinary course of affairs. The mood is due
to the fact that Caesar’s thought is here expressed3 ‘because, as he
reflected, great crises often occurred from a slight disturbance of
equilibrium’.

3 perpetuis] ‘with an unbroken line of sentries and outposts’.

ommm munitionem] ‘the whole line of investment’.
4 praefectos] ‘cavalry officers'.
caveant] jussive subjunctive after hortatur: there is no need to
supply ut.

5 qui...conquicverit] qui=ut is, and therefore this sentence gives an
instance of the perfect in a consecutive clause following a perfect in the
main clause; though Draeger H. S. 1. ἓ 133 says that there are no
instances of this in the B. C. He quotes 5 from the Β. G, as
eg. 11. ar tecnpocis tanta suit exiguitas...ut ad galeas induendas tempus
defuerit.

6 auritatae rerum] ‘the ultimate issue ', ‘the crisis of their fortunes’:
cp. 11. 305 1, 111. 5154, B. Al. 16.

aspectatio] almost ‘anxiety about'3 cp. 111. 19 ἓ 4 magnaque erat
expectatio eius rei.

mente atque animo] a stereotyped phrase in which all distinction
between the two words is lost sight of, as in our expression ‘with all
one’s heart and soul’. Properly speaking the mnu is the intellectual
part of the animus: cp. B. G. 111. 19, VI. 5, and often in Cicero and
Lucretius.

queat..asaueret...cxcperent] ‘tin suspense as to) what was happening
