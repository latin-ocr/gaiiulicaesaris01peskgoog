under whose superintenrlence the place has been thoroughly examined,
states that each mole or pier was about 75 yards long. This would leave

a channel of aco yards which would be further lessened by the rafts.
p· 15. 6 altiore aqua] ablative of attendant circumstances.

continere] ‘held together': the water being deep the dam broke up
as fast as it was made. Dr Reid thinks contineri wrong and suggests
continuari ,· because of the depth of the water Caesar could not carry
the mole across in an unbroken line, cp. corrtr'nuare pontem Tac. Ann.
xv. 9.

rates duplices] it is not clear whether this means two rafts, each
30 st. by 15 st, placed side by side so as to form as it were asingle raft
of 30 st. square, or whether we must suppose that for the sake of
additional carrying power one raft was placed on the top of another,
each of the two being 30 feet square. On the whole Ι prefer the latter
view supported by Gdler and Stoffel. Dr Reid however suggests that
the word duplices may mean that the rafts were made in pairs and one
of each pair anchored at each of the two incomplete aggeres. Some
objection has been raised by Gtiler and others to the number XXX, on

the ground that rafts 30 ft. square would not be large enough for the
various erections placed on them, but I do not think that any alteration
ψ is needed.

aregiam molis] ‘over against the end of the mole‚' forming as it were
a continuation of the mole.

7 destinabat] ‘made fast’, cp. B. G. 111. 14, v11. aa, aud perhaps w. 17.
8 iungebat] ‘attached’ to the end of the former. It was Caesar's
intention to unite the two ends of the piers by a chain of rafts and so
bar the channel, but the work was never completed, cp. 27 ὅ 1 prope
dinnao parte operis efficta ; how many rafts were placed in position we
cannot now say, but probably more than ‘three or four‘ which is Col.
Stoffel's estimate, for Caesar says that he proceeded to erect towers ‘on
every fourth raft’. This argument however will not hold if the im·
perfect excitabat denotes merely the unfulfrlled intention. It would
require ao rafts to fill up the whole space between the piers supposing it
to have been 200 yards.
9 terra atque aggere] ‘soil and a raised causeway’.
ne aditus...impediretur] ‘that there might be no obstacle in the
way of approach or ingress for the purpose of defence ’.
a fronte] the front or end of the raft facing mid-channel ; as each raft
was completed these defences a fronte would, I suppose, be removed
and transferred to the front or end of the next raft aad so on„
