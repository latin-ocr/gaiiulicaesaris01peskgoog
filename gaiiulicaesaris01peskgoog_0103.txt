3 Apulia] Appian says twice (B. C. 11. 29, 31) that the two legions
wintered in Capua: possibly they were stationed there first and moved
to Apulia later on. Cicero no doubt refers to these legions in Att. V1L
12 5 a ille iter Lariuum5 itt enim cohortes et Luceriae et Teani reliquaque
iu Apulia. That they were not all in one town is shown by the word
dr'sposuerat ‘had distributed’. Stoffel 1. 204.

gladiatores] Caesar kept a traiuing school (ludus) for gladiators at
Capua. Pompey wished to enlist them in lris army, but public feeling
