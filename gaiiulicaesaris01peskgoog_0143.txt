112 DE BELLO CI VILI. [ura. 1.

tumulus] thisis the Puig Bordel, a slight eminence in the plain
between Ilerda and the site os Afranius' camp.

r occupavisset] ‘should occupy'; literally‚ ‘should have occupied ’, the
act being regarded from the point oi view of the ensuing result. So in
such sentences as ‘he offers a reward to anyone who should do this '‚ we
should write liae fecisset, lit. ‘should have done this ’.

3 legiones III] we know irom the subsequent narrative that two ol
these were the IXth and the Xthh.

unius legionis] the XIVth.

antesignanos] what the antesignani were isa question that has been
much debated aud perhaps does not now admit of solution. Three
views may here be mentioned: (i) They were the iour cohorts forming
the first line of the legion, drawn up in iront ol the signa, behind which
came the other two lines, consisting oi three cohorrs each. The number
ol the antesignani would thus be {rh (fahs) ol the whole legion, which,
assuming the XIVth legion to have contained 3000 men (Stofiel’s
estimare), would be 1200. (ii) They were the two sront ranks ol the ten
cohorts which were drawn up in one line, 8 ranks deep. The 30 signa ol
the different maniples (oi which there were three to a cohort) were
carried in the second rank, and the men of this rank as well as nithe
first were called antesignani, while the remaining 6 ranks were post·
agauni. ll the legion contained 3000 rnen, the two front ranks would
contain {ihs or {th oi the whole, that is, 750 men. This is M. Stofsel's
view which he developes at some length vol. 11. p. 329 foll. (iii) T hey
were not any definite portion ol a legion, but were merely a body oi
men oi uncertain number picked from the legion and employed in any
sudden emergency where there was need ol a small force ol tried
contage and able to execute rapid movemcnts. Whichever of these
views be adopted, and 1 incline to the first, it will be seen that the
antesignani were reclroned the best soldiers iu the legion. On the
whole subject see MM. V. 342 ioll.; Giiler, Biirgerkrieg p. 36 soll,
Stofiel 11. 329 soll, S. D. A. sv. exercitus.

4 breviore itinere] Caesar’s three legions were apparently drawn up iu
a line fronting Ilerda, Puig Bordel and Gardeny, the XIVth being ou

the lest oi his position and so the farthest from Gardeny and the IXth in
the centre. The antesignani were suddenly detached from the XIVth
to seize Bordel but were anticipated by the cohorts ol Afranius which

were not so iar off.
5 aliis submissis subsidiis] ‘when other reserves had been sent up ',

by Afranius to assist his cohorts that had occupied the mound.
