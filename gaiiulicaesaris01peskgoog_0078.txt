(ihs text oi this book being in a very unsettled state, the Appendin
‘On the Text' should be consulted throughout.)

The marginal numbers refer to the sections.

Crine. Ι.

p. 1· r Caesare] the text is uncertain and we should perhaps read
with Η. Nissen litteris Caesaris a C. Fabia consulibus redditis, in which
case Fabius, who was a trusted legate of Caesar osten mentioned in
B. G. vm„ must be supposed to have accompanied C. Scribonius Curio
who is elsewhere spoken oi as the bearet oi the letter, as iu Dion
Cassius xu. 66,x1.1. ¹3 Appian, B. C. 11. 323 cp. Cic. Fam. xvl. rr
§a omnino et ipse Caesar antaeus noster minaces ademarum et arabas
litteras miserat et erat adhuc impudens qui manaem ct provinciam invito
emolumenti, et Curia meas illum incitabat.

consulibus] C. Claudius Marcellus and L. Cornelius Lentulus crus.
The former was a cousin oi the C. Marcellus who was consul in 50 and
brother of M. Marcellus consalin 51. Caesaris relating the proceedings
in the senate house on 1 Jan. 49 ae.

tribunorum] the tribunes particularly reiened to are Q. Cassius
Longinus, formerly quaestor to Pompey, and M. Antonius. With
grem difficulty they persuaded the consuls to read the letter to the
senate, but could not induce them to make any definite statement on the
immediate subject oi the letter (ax litteris resem ad sanatum). Pro·
bably the tribunes and others kept shouting referi refer Ι, cp. Cic. Cat.
ι. ao. The tribunes were originally only allowed a seat outside the
door ol the senate house whence they might watch the proceedings3 at
ahter period, probably in the seoond century ac.. they gained the
privilege oi becoming members oi the senate and the ius reserandi.
