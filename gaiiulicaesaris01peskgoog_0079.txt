o referrent] it was usual for the new consuls at the beginning of the
year to make a general ‘ reference’ to the senate on public affairs, each
senator in turn being asked to state his views, qnid fieri placeat. 1
object to Hotoman’s infinite in place of the corrupt in cinz'tate on the
ground that if the word had been in ordinary use we should find it
elsewhere in the historians or in Cicero, and moreover it is not clear

that Gellius, xlv. γῇ 9, actually found the word in Varro from whom he

audacter ocsomiter] ‘ with boldness and resolution'.
sententias dicere] ‘express their opinions' on the point submitted to
them: the presiding magistrate was said rogare sententias. ¹

3 ut fecerint]=ut fecistis in oratio recta. Among the previous occasions
referred to, Lentulus may be thinking of the debate in November 50
when the senate voted by 370 to aa in favour of Curio’s proposal‚
or of the crowd of senators who waited on Caesar during his residence

promissione provinciae, Romam ut redeat, cui permaderi posse non
arbitror, ne‘si erit cononatus.

4 Scipio] Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio, son of Cornelius Scipio
and adopted by Q. CaeciliusMetellus Pius. He was consul with Pompey
ior the last five months of the year 52, and in that year Pompey married
his daughter Cornelia widow of Publius Crassus.

eius]=Pompei.

r adnot] the sentence is unsatisfactory-whether one reads aderat or
aberat: with aderat, meaning ‘was in the neighbourhood ', Caesar would
