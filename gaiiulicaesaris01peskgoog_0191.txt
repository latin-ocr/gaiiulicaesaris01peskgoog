160 DE BELLO CI VIM.

³⁹ sThe word Hispaniae is worse than useless after the previous pro·
vinciae and should no doubt he ejected as a gloss. Nipperdey goes
too far, I think, in omitting the three genitivos citerioris provinciae,
altmaris Hispaniae, and utriusque provinciae. Madvig would omit
only the words ulterioris Hispaniae. The text of this chapter is in a
sadly disordered condition.
aad VI milia auxilia peditum milia most uss. The number Vl is
right as denoting the number of legions sent into Spain by Caesar ς
hence the words ad and milia should probably be omitted. Then a
numeral seems to be lost between peditum and uilius this should
probably be V, cp. Cic. Att. tx. 13 § 4. Ε. Hoffmann reads prae·
miserat VI: ad illa (ι in addition to these ⁹) auxilia peditum V mdia.
omuibus uss, except d which has quae omuibus which is probably
correct.
quarn ipse pacaverat MSS, rightly 1 think, as Caesar uses this
expression in reference to the subjugation of a country, cp. B. G. 111.
28 omui Galla pacata, etc. Paul writes equitum tria milia menibus
superioribus bellis habuerat et parem ex Gallia nanterum epse paraverat
nominatim etc. E. Hoffmann equitum tria milia, quae omnibuis
superioribas bellis haiuaat et parem ea Gallia numerum pern ipse
parauerat nominatim etc.
duic lass, huc most editors, et isim (⁴and out of tlrem') E.

Hoffmann3 others suppose some number such as CCCC (Menge) to
be concealed in this word. Ι have thought it possible that M (mille)
may have fallen out after homiuum.

atingani auds'erat uss ; one word at least seems to have fallen

out arser attingunt somewhat similar inform to audierat, perhaps
adiecerat or addiderat. Possibly the subject of audierat has also been

lost.
⁴0 3congressae Mssa egressae Iurinius rightly, cp. correptis for ereptis in
284.
propn'o legiones MSS, except a, which has propria relegionis:
Nipperdey's restoration propiare ponte legiones is no doubt right.
E. Hoffmann (retaining congressae) prefers prope priores regiones.
impedimentaque uss, see note: Paul iumentaque·
iumentorum uss absurdly for vi uentorum which is found in a
Norwich urs.
4 legana l V h l f, legiones Illa b; the latter is right.
41 r noctu f hl, nacte a; as an adverbial expression of time without any
adjunct the former is more common in Caesar than the latter.
