p. 24. qnod...petendns] proper material for an agger would have been '
difficult to get3 Caesar therefore contined himself for the present to
drawing a wide trench round his camp.

similem] that is, like what it had been the day before. It will be
remembered that he had theo made the third line of hIs troops excavate
the fosse behind the other two lines which were confronting the foe ; he
uow proceeds with each of the three remaining sides of the encampment
in the same way, appointing one legion to make the fosse on each side,
thus employing three legions simultaneously‚ while the three remaining
legions kept guard on the side facing the enemy.

ad] we should say ‘of' the same siae: ad denotes the standard of
comparison.

in armis] like snb arnrir ‘under arms’: then expeditas will be ⁴ tightly
equipped'‚ that is, not encumbered with any unnecessary weight. Paul
absurdly concludes from Β. G. vn. rr ἐξ 6,8 that the two expressions
in armai· and expeditas mean the same thing, aud would therefore eject
one of them here.

praesidia] the ablative expresses the ground of his confidence; ‘by

pressiug the nature of the munim, ‘the defensive work of the fosse ’.

5 tertio die] 25 June.

vallo] this probably deuotes a stout palisading fixed iu the bank of
earth produced from the excavation of the fosse: ‘a palisaded rampart '-
This would of course surround the camp iranile the fosse.

reliquas colona] the sir cohorts left in charge of Fabius' camp.

Clite. XLIII.

ι planities] this, and not planicies, is no doubt the right spelling.
There is very little authority for the forro planitia adopted here by Paul.
