aede Apollinis, where he is probably referring to this occasion: cp. Luc.
111. ¹03· Merivale says they met in the temple of Bellona which was
also outside the ponarium, but this is less likely.

r legimus...X] it is difficult to say how the ten legions are to bc
reckoned, nor can we be sure that Pompey ever made the statement
here attributed to him by Caesar. He probably means the seven legions
in Spain, the two taken from Caesar, aud the force under Domitius amount·
ing to about one more legion. Mommsen however, R. H. w. 389 soll,
believes that Pompey had about ro legions in Italy without reckoning
the Spanish army, viz. three remaining from the levies of 55, the troops
raised in 52, and two withdrawn from Caesar. KH agree in excluding
the absent Spanish troops irom the account, and suppose the number to
be made up by the forces raised by Pompey at the end of 50 (Appian, B.
C. 11. 31, Plut. Ant. 5) aud iu the beginning of this year 49. This view of
Mommsen¹s is severely and, 1 think, justly criticised by M. Stoffel,
Histoire de Jules cesar, 1. 207 soll3 cp. Giiler Biirgerkrieg, p. a.

molitas] Caesar's own troops; so Appian, B. C. 11. 30, says that
messengers ἰσχυρίζοντο aqi Πομπηίῳ τὴν στρατιὰν Καίσαρος τετρυμένην se
πόνῳ sai χρόνῳ, sal τὰ aluos ποθοῦσαν, μεταθήσεσθαι πρὸς αὑτὸν ὅτε τὰ
Ἄλπεια dationes: cp. Plut. Caes. ²9· There was no tmth in the
report, except so lar as it might be justified by the defection of one oi
Caesar's most trusted officers, Labienus, which took place about this time.

aut sequantur saltem] ‘or at any rate follow him' i.e. is he wanted to
advance on Rome. saltem is only used here in Caesar: cp. Cic. Att.
tx. 6 ᾗ 5 m'pe hunc dolorem aut minue saltem.

3 Faustus Sulla] L. Cornelius Sulla Faustus son oi the dictator Sulla
who when he took the title of Felix gave his twin children the
appellatives Faustus and Fausta. He married Pompey’s daughter
Pompeia: in 46 he was killed in Asrica by Caesar who spared his wise
and children; cp. B. At. 95.

Mauritaniam] the north-westem portion of Africa corresponding
to part of Morocco and Algeria. Bocchus, son of the Bocchus who
surrendered Jugurtha to the Dictator Sulla, was king oi the eastern
portion and his brother (i) Bogud oi the western. By means ol Faustus
Pompey might hope to establish friendly relations with these princes.

4 haba] King of Numidia. The extent of his dominions is described
in exaggerated language by Lucan tv. 670 foll. His political attitude
is stated in B. C. 11. ²5 huic at paternum hospitium cum Pompeio et
simultas cum Curione interccdebat, quod tribunus plebis legam promulga-
