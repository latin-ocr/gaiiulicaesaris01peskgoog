cnop. xxix. xxx] NOTES. 95

nuenr'cipiorum] it is possible that the word maritimorum may have
fallen out after municipiorum, for Caesar is evidently thinking only of
the munuipia on the coast, Tarentum, Sipontum, etc: see on 3² ἓ 1.

deducendas] for deducere used of bringing a vessel into port cp· 36

ἓν, B. ΑΙ. 113 on the other hand it is more often used of launching a
ship‚asin B. G. v. a.
o Sardiniam] Sardinia and Corsica together formed one oi the Roman
provinces and were governed by a propraetor, at this time Μ. Cotta.
Caesar was anxious to secure the three great corn-producing countries
Sardinia, Sicily and Africa, on which Rome was dependent for its
supplies of food : cp. Appian B. C. 11. 40 ἑτέρους δ’ ἔπεμπεν ἅμα Κοίντῳ
Οὐαλερίῳ Σαρδὼ τὴν νῆσον καταλαβεῖν πυροφοροῦσαν· καί κατέλαβον.

Curionem] Appian ll. C. 11. 41 ἔς πε rd ἔξω, Κουρίωνα μὲν α’ντί

Κοίπωνος ἡρεῖτο ἡγεῖσθαι Σικελίας, Κόιντον δὲ Σαρδοῦς.
· legionibus ΙΙ] this, not III, is no doubt right. The four legions
mentioned in 11. ης 1 are these two together with the two legions of
Domitius previously despatched to Sicily under Asinius Pollio: see
note on 2552.

Africam] the Roman province of Africa corresponded roughly to
Tunis and part of Tripoli as sar as the greater Syrtes (Gulf of Sidra).

M. Cotta] M. Aurelius Cotta sou of the like-named consul of 74.
Caesar despatched Valerius and Curio during the last week of March,
after the capture of Brundisium and before his arrival in Rome; and he
says here that Cotta was expelled from Sardinia before Valerius left
Italy. Hence the rumour that reached Cicero in May that Cotta was
still holding Sardinia must have been false, Cic. Art. x. 16 5 3 Cato qai
Siciliam unere nullo negotio potuit et, si tenuisset, onmes doni ad eum se
contulissent, Syracusis prroj'ectus est antediem viii K. Mai, ut adme
Curio scripsit. utinam, quod aiunl, Cotta Sardiniam terreat! est enim
rumor: o, si id fuerit, tropen Catonem!

sone] cp. Cic. p. Lig. ar Tuberonis sors coniecta est ex senalus
consulta ,· ογ iusto crem impera ex senatus cousrelto in prouinciam suam
venerat.

Tubero] L. Aelius Tubero was appointed by the Senate to govern
Africa as propraetor ior the year 49. The previous governor C.
Considius having abdicated before the expiration of his office had
informally delegated his powers to his legatus Q. Ligarius (Cic. p. Lig.
ol, who on the news of the outbreak of war reaching Africa refused to
take any prominent part for Pompey, to whose interests the inhabitants
were devoted, and practically resigned his post. Thermum. mma
