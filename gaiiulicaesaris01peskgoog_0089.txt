58 DE BELLO CI VILI. [nra. 1.

socius] the Romans osten granted these titles to friendly foreign
kings or chieftains, eg. B. G. 1. 3 Catamantaloedes3 35, 43 Ariovistus3
tv. ra the grandfather of Piso Aquitanus; vn. 31 Ollovico; cp. B. ΑΙ.
34 regna sociorum atque nmr'corum. Juba was afterwards declared by
Caesar an enemy of the¹Roman people, but received distinctions and
the title of rex from Pompey‚ Dion xm. 4²·

Marcellm...negat] the reason for his objection is doubtful. Moberley
says “Marcellus stopped this measure probably because the combination
of Bocchus with Juba, even as allies of the senate, would be dangerous ;
especially considering that a stoppage of the African corn-ships might
starve Rome, if events led the two kings to form such a plan’'. The
German editors ignore the difficulty.

ἐκ praesentali] I take this as abl. sing. cimmeria, so both Merguet
and Meusel in their Lern s. ιι others regard it as n. pl. of praesens.
[in praesens is first found in Livy, and the final use of in apart from
some verb such as venire to help it out is not classical. J. S. n]

5 Philidpus] L. Marcius Philippus, praetor in 44, son of the consul
of 56, for whom see below. Cic. Phil. ιιι. ²5 calls him vir patre avo

perscribuntur] there being no opposition they are passed and re-
corded.

privatis] since the tirne of Sulla it had been usual for the consuls
and praetors to proceed to their provincial administrations on the
expiration of their tenu of office at Rome, but in 5² it was enacted
that for the future a period of five years should elapse between the
consulship or praetorship and the provincial administration3 the regular

succession of provincial governors under this rule would not begin till
47 or 46, and meanwhile the provinces had to be assigned to err-consuls

or ex·praetors who had as yet held no provincial governorships. The
exact method by which this was to be done cannot now be satisfactorily
determined ; see Mommsen, Rechtsfrage, p. 45, n. 118. There were iu
all ¹4 provinces to dispose of. '

Scipioni] see note on 1 5 4. The province of Syria had been
assigned to M. Crassus in 55 for 5 years, together with the conduct
of the war against the Parthians. In 53 Crassus and his son were
defeated and slain. The position of Syria, exposed as it wasto the

formidable power of the Parthians, sufficiently accounts for the pro-
minence assigned to it.

L. Dorm'tr'o] L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, consul 54. The governor-
ship of Gaul, the scene of Caesar's long course of victory, was obviously
