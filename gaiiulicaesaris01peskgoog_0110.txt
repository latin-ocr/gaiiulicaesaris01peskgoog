caer. xvrr. xv111.] NOTES.

codem die] probably the r6th.
4 operibm] siege-works.
5 eo triduo] ‘within three days‘, i.e. on the third day of the siege, 17
Feb. cp. eo biduo, 4¹ ξ 1.

legio VIII] this, us well as the XIIth, had been under the command
of Fabius among the Aedui, see note on 15 §3. Fabius had recently
had 4 legions under his command (Β. G. vm. 54); he would now have
only two after the departure of the xnth and vlrrth, but in 37 5 r he is
said to have 3, hence it is supposed that Trebonius who had 4more
in Belgio Gaul was ordered to transfer one of histo Fabius, and this
supposition is supported by 36 ἓ 4.

Gallrbe] Gallia Cisalpina, where Caesar had spent the winter. In
addition to these aa cohorts, he had the 7 cohorts which had formed the
garrison of Sulmo, and a few others (perhaps 7) which he had picked up
on his march from the scattered garrisons of Auximum and Asculum,
thus making a total of 36. These 36 cohorts were probably now
organised into three legions, which with the previous three veteran
legions, viz. the v111th‚ x11tl1, x111th‚ made up an effective force of six
legions, to which may be added a body of cavalry. M. Stoffel
reckons his whole force to have consisted of aa,ooo infantry and rooo
cavalry.

rege Norico] Noricum was the country between the Danube and the
Alps, with chief town Noreia now N eumarkt in Carinthia. The N ori·
cans were perhaps grateful to Caesar for having relieved them from the
pressure of their enemies by his defeat of the Boii and their allies the
Helvetii in 58, B. G. 1. 5. One of Ariovistus’ wives was the sister of
the Noric king Voccio, whether the same king that is mentioned here or
not, is uncertain: B. G. 1. 53.

altera castra] on the S. W. of the town, commanding the via Valeria
and the gorge of Raiano.

p. 11, 6 vallo castellisque] ‘with a line of earthvvorks and redoubts'z
castella were, as their name implies, ‘little camps' or fortified enclosuras,
placed at intervals along the line of circumvallation and capable of ac·
commodating small bodies of troops. In the siege of Alesia Caesar
constructed ²3 castella, and at Dyrrachium Pompey had ²4· From
careful researches conducted on the spot M. stofsel believes that Caesar's
line of investment formed a circuit of 5 miles.

circumrirunire] 1 prefer this to the reading of the uss circumvenire,
notwithstanding the instances of the latter in Sallust lug. 68, 76. ln B. C.
111. 97 the weight of rus authority is in favour of circummunire.
